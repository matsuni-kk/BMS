Letter from Luis
Duolingo is a quirky place.
Our culture wasn’t copied from a tech startup playbook. It was
built from scratch by a few dozen nerds in an office above a
sports bar in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
For most of our early employees, Duolingo was their first real
job. Without much experience, we had to experiment our way
through the basic questions: Who should we hire? What’s the
best way to build an app? How should we organize ourselves
to build it? Doing it this way took time. But in the end, nothing
could have been better for our culture and success.
Over time, we’ve sharpened our answers to these questions and
many more. Now, fourteen years in, we’ve decided to put these
answers into writing, and articulate how we do things.
At the center of this book are five principles. These aren’t
aspirational—they’re lessons we've learned through experience.
But they’re also living ideas: they have tensions within them, and
there are places where they don’t always fit. We hope you study
them, challenge them, and help us make the next version of this
book even better.
Thanks for reading.
And welcome to Duolingo.
— Luis

TL;DR
• We’re building a forever product that puts long-term user
retention first.
• We hire exceptional people who will grow with Duolingo and
shape its future for years to come.
• We’re creating a 100-year brand with delightful, quirky
characters that become a part of learners’ lives.• We lead with the results of our work, not the story of its
effort.

makes our fans laugh, even if not everyone gets the joke.
• We design our offices and culture to be quirky and
welcoming, sparking joy and connection among Duos.
The Green Machine is our approach to building things:
• Staff it with great people
• Define success
• Set guardrails and think long-term
• Build the thing and set up feedback loops
• Execute with urgency and excellence
• Double down on what works, stop what doesn’t• Every feature we ship must be intuitive, delightful, useful,
and polished.
• We make sure critical tasks have a clear owner.
• We constantly dogfood our products to identify bugs and
propose improvements.
• We give candid feedback that focuses on the “what” and
not the “who.”
• We optimize “clock speed,” minimizing gaps between steps to
maintain momentum.
• We run hundreds of experiments each week in order to
constantly improve our products and our organization.
• We ruthlessly prioritize projects with the highest impact and
quickly cut what isn’t working.

A Note Before Reading
Duolingo is a product-led organization. But the ideas in this
book aren’t just about building a great product—they’re about
building a great company, together.
Not every section applies to every employee in every situation.
Think of the principles simply as a guide to understanding how
we work when we’re at our best.Table of Contents

# ページ 7

Duolingo was never
going to be a sprint.
It wasn’t a quick experiment, or a weekend side hustle.
We knew that building the best education app in the
world would be a multidecade effort—and that it
would require patience. But patience—that is, taking
the long view—is hard.
Take advertising. We could increase revenue
tomorrow by showing more ads in the app. But we
know that too many ads can annoy users and stifle
long-term growth, potentially compromising our goal
of making the best education universally available.
This is a real trade-off. But over and over, we’ve taken
the long view. We have to: our goals are too big to
think any other way.Not every company is able to operate like this. But we had a few
early advantages that made taking the long view possible. For
one, Luis had already sold his first company, reCAPTCHA, in
2009. As he put it: “This gave me the flexibility and perspective
to think about our mission first and foremost.”
So we set out to build something groundbreaking—the kind
of educational tool our children and grandchildren might still
be using. The clarity of this vision, along with the trust of
our earliest investors, gave us leeway as we figured out what
Duolingo could be. Equally important: we hired folks who were
just as crazy about our mission. Back then, many of them could
have doubled their salaries working at bigger tech companies.
But they didn’t come here to make a quick buck—they came here
to build the best learning tool on the planet.
The temptation of short-term wins can be powerful. We had a
simple mantra in the early days: “Don’t do dumb s**t.” Looking
back, this was the first version of “Take the Long View.” We knew
that to have any shot at meaningful success, we had to steer
clear of gimmicks and tricks that might seem helpful in the
short-term but hurt us down the road.In the Beginning
Don’t Do Dumb S**t

Betting on Technology
Long View HiringTaking the long view isn’t just about what you avoid—
it’s also what you embrace. We are tech optimists.
From the beginning, we’ve believed that technology
will advance enough to make our most ambitious ideas
possible. And betting on that has been crucial to how
we operate. For example, we invested in early text-to-
speech systems instead of recording human voices:
even though our audio sounded robotic at first, we
knew the technology would improve with time.
Hiring decisions are some of the most important
decisions we make. That’s why we take time to find the
right person — even if it means waiting. Each new hire
needs to meet our bar. Is this person exceptional? Are
they willing to get their hands dirty? Are they a clear
communicator? Will they prioritize what’s best for the
company over their personal goals?
We don’t compromise our hiring standards to fill a hole
in the organization, especially when it comes to being a
team player. As we say at Duolingo: “Better a hole than
an a**hole.”The good thing is, when you hire the right people, they tend
to stick around. And our experience validates this: on average,
Duos stay here much longer than employees at most tech
companies. Many are exceptional generalists who start with us
as new college grads, develop their skills here, and take on new
challenges over time. Whatever your experience level, we want
you here for the long run.

Building a Forever Product
The Duolingo app is designed to be sticky in the short-
term and transformative in the long-term. For years,
we’ve focused on building something so useful and
delightful that it becomes an essential part of our
learners’ lives.
Learning—particularly language learning—requires
regular practice over extended periods of time. That’s
why we prioritize user retention, and have spent years
perfecting the Streak feature. The more we can do to
keep our learners committed for the long haul, the
more value they’ll get from Duolingo.
We also invest in teaching better. Even though this
doesn’t generate immediate revenue, we know that if
a product fails to deliver on its promise, people will
eventually stop using it.  Notifications
JuicyEvery day, Duolingo sends millions of messages to learners.
These notifications present a fundamental tension between
long-term thinking and short-term goals.
More notifications leads to more Daily Active Users (DAUs)*
in the short-term. But people who feel bombarded don’t stick
around for long—they eventually turn off notifications or
abandon the app entirely. That's why we put firm limits on
notifications, regardless of what the short-term metrics suggest.
User trust matters more than immediate gains.
Duolingo didn’t always look like the app you see today. For years,
it featured a light gray background, muted button colors, and a
more robotic-looking Duo. But in 2018, a few of our designers
and illustrators began working on a concept for a kids’ app. With
brighter colors, rounder corners, and a cuter, friendlier Duo, the
new design made learning feel more like a game. It was exactly
the kind of playful experience we wanted for the main app. So,
even though we didn’t expect it to boost metrics in the short-
term, we took the leap and applied this new design language—
dubbed Juicy—across all of Duolingo.
DAUs: Daily Active Users. The number of individuals using Duolingo every day across
iOS, Android, and the website.

Setting the Proficiency Standard
When asked how much English somebody knows, we want them
to say, “My Duolingo Score is 70.” The Duolingo Score is an
estimate of users’ proficiency in the language they’re learning,
and the Duolingo English Test (DET) is a way to certify the
score that can be used for high-stakes purposes, like university
admissions. Together, they form our two-pronged approach
to becoming the standard measure for language proficiency.
Putting the score in the app gives us volume—hundreds of
millions of people see it. Having a way to certify it with the DET
gives us credibility—the score can get you admission to even the
most prestigious universities in the world.
Of course, becoming the proficiency standard is not easy, and
could take decades—but that’s exactly why the Duolingo Score
and the DET are great examples of taking the long view.This redesign wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was an investment
in the future. While risky and resource intensive, it set the
foundation for the playful world that now defines our brand:
expressive characters, delightful animations, and a learning
experience that feels like play. By taking the long view, we
created a design language that would scale with the product for
years to come.  Engineering the Future
Becoming a BusinessIn engineering, taking the long view requires a slightly
different approach. We know that we will still be improving
our products years from now. So, we don’t build systems to
last forever. Instead, we test ideas quickly and only invest
significant engineering resources when something is successful.
If something doesn’t work, we move on quickly, keeping the
codebase clean and minimizing waste.
Video Call is a great example. We only invested in scaling and
stabilizing it for long-term use once it showed traction with
users. Another example relates to notifications. When we
realized we’d be testing notification copy for years to come, we
built a custom tool that allows Product Managers to test copy
without engineering support.
This balance—focusing on speed while reserving long-term
investments for what truly works—has guided our success.
For years, Duolingo didn’t make money. We were laser-focused
on growing our user base and keeping learners engaged. Also,
some of us worried that monetizing Duolingo could get in the
way of our mission.
That perspective began to shift after our Series D funding round
in 2015. We started exploring revenue models—in-app purchases
(IAPs), advertising, and paid subscriptions—with one key caveat:
they could never compromise our mission. We weren’t going to
put learning behind a paywall.
16 17

# ページ 11

Long-Term Value
If we report less revenue than expected in a quarter, our stock would likely go down. But we
don’t overindex on quarterly financials—we focus on having the most long-term impact for
our learners. If we’re successful, that will inevitably raise our value as a company.Building a Monetization Engine
We started with in-app purchases, but there wasn’t
much to “buy” except a Streak Freeze. Advertising
was also capped. We found that we could show one
ad after each lesson without affecting user retention,
but more than that would drive people away.
It became clear that introducing a freemium
subscription product was the best opportunity to
scale the business. The hard part was doing so while
still offering an excellent product for those who
couldn’t pay. We landed on a subscription package
that eliminated ads and gave learners unlimited
hearts. Both of these features remove friction from
the app. Over the years, we’ve continued to tweak this
model, but the core dynamic is the same: the paid
product gives us the resources to pursue our mission
at the greatest scale, and the free product is largely
how that mission is achieved.
Plenty of investors—and even some of us at Duolingo
—wondered whether offering such a great free
product would provide too little incentive for learners
to subscribe. There will likely always be a tension
between accessibility and revenue. But over time, our
approach to monetization has shown that we can
strike this balance, achieving long-term loyalty while
building a large business.A 100-Year Brand
Through steady growth and clever marketing, we’ve made
Duolingo a household name. Even people who’ve never used the
app are familiar with our mascot, the delightful—if sometimes
unhinged—Duo. We’ve invested a ton in Duo’s journey, along
with the rest of our characters and the world they inhabit. This
says a lot about our ambitions. We’re not just trying to help
people get better at French. We want to build a brand and set of
characters that become a part of people’s lives, turning everyone
in the world into daily learners.

Characters Count Investing in Marketing
Our characters make learning fun. Built from simple geometric
shapes, each has a distinct personality and story. Together, they
reflect the diversity of our learners and bring a sense of humor
and play to the app.
But these characters—inspired more by brands like Nintendo
than traditional learning companies—also serve an important
strategic purpose. We see this IP as a crucial moat for our
business, especially in the era of AI learning tools. That same
emotional connection that makes learning enjoyable also makes
our product stickier over time. Even if someone cloned our
entire app, learners would still come back to Duolingo for the
characters.At Duolingo, we’ve grown by creating a product that people
genuinely love—and love to talk about. But we’ve also figured
out how to use other levers, like performance marketing, to
complement that organic growth. Our paid ads exist to amplify
our word-of-mouth momentum, not replace it, so we are
conservative with our spend. This allows us to invest in standout
campaigns and reactive social moments that set us apart.
Our marketing team excels at creating high-impact content at a
low cost. Thanks to their work, Duo has walked the red carpet at
the Barbie premiere, hosted a (fake) dating reality show on the
streaming service Peacock, and become an international social
media star. These moments reflect the playful, irreverent energy
of our brand and show how a thoughtful balance of organic
growth and marketing can create meaningful impact.

The Path
Originally, learners navigated Duolingo through the Tree, which
consisted of skills (e.g., going to a restaurant). Each skill began
with basic word meanings and progressed to harder content, but
learners only needed to complete the first level to move on. While
this flexibility let them advance quickly, it often led to frustration
when harder concepts came along and exposed gaps in their
foundational knowledge.
In 2022, we took a leap: replacing the Tree with the Path. This
new linear structure requires learners to complete every lesson
in sequence, ensuring a consistent and strong foundation
for everyone. The Path was a large undertaking across both
engineering and design. We anticipated that learners might
resist such a dramatic change to their routine. And even though
the data didn’t immediately show improvements in core metrics
like DAUs or monetization, the switch was the right decision.
It prioritized real mastery over speedrunning easy lessons to
maintain streaks. It also gave us clearer insights into learner
progress and greater control over the learning experience.
Sometimes taking the long view means making bold moves that
might seem counterproductive in the moment. The Path was just
that. It fundamentally changed how people learn with Duolingo
and has been essential to our success.

Excellence isn’t some
lofty goal—it’s our
baseline.
The expectation is that we’ll do the best work of our
careers here, constantly pushing our craft and ideas
to meet our bar and then exceed it.
Still, we’re human, and we’re going to make mistakes.
When that happens, we don’t chase blame. We dig
in and figure out what happened. This is how we
continuously raise the bar—not by being perfect, but
by being a little bit better each day.Culture of Excellence
Our bar for quality was set at the top and at the beginning. Luis,
Severin, and the early team share a nearly ridiculous attention
to detail. (Luis is the rare CEO who still reports every bug he
finds in the app.) But it’s no longer just about leadership or
any individual Duo. As the company has grown, we’ve worked
together to define clear standards for excellence and scale them
across the organization.
Taking Ownership
Hard on the Work, Easy on the PeopleOne key to maintaining high standards is assigning ownership.
That means putting a person or team on a task, providing a clear
mandate and saying, “You are responsible.” We’ve seen it again
and again: only things that are owned become excellent.
As we grow, unclear ownership can become a challenge. One
task might stretch across four functions and seven teams, and
it’s not clear who owns what. There will always be some projects
where defining ownership is tricky, or impossible. But the most
important projects at the company should have an owner.
Our culture is famously warm and friendly. And that’s great!
But a warm-and-fuzzy culture can make it hard to have tough
conversations. We’ve always been clear when giving feedback
on design and product, but we want to be more candid in other
areas, too.
27 26

# ページ 16

Dogfooding
Another key way we maintain excellence is by using the app
daily. This ensures that we ourselves love the product and that
bugs are spotted and resolved quickly. To make this process
even more effective, we built Shake to Report, a simple tool
that lets anyone in the company snapshot and report an issue
instantly by shaking their device. Over the years, Shake to Report
has become a vital part of our development process, making
excellence in the app a shared responsibility.The standard here is “hard on the work, easy on the people.”
That means giving constructive, clear feedback that sharpens
ideas without undermining relationships.  (We stick to the
“what,” not the “who.”) It also means being open to receiving
feedback and not taking it personally. This candid, constructive
approach allows us to hold each other to high standards while
fostering trust and collaboration.
What exactly is a “feature”?  At Duolingo, a feature is any part of the app that
performs a key named function for the learner. The Streak is a feature; so is DuoRadio.
Some parts of the app do not get this title. For example, most single screens—like the
session end card you see after you finish a lesson—aren’t considered features.Setting the Bar
So, where exactly is this excellence bar, and how do we make
sure we’re hitting it? Let’s see what this looks like across a few
areas of the company.
The Bar for Product and Design
Useful: Learners need to get utility out of whatever we’ve
built. Otherwise, we’ve made something that adds more
complexity to the app and distracts learners from what
they’re here to do.
Intuitive: Learners should be learning, not figuring out
how to use the app. Every feature must be easy to use for
everyone—it doesn’t matter whether they’re a 75-year-
old in India using an Android or a 16-year-old in New
York City on an iPhone. If a feature or screen requires
explanation or additional context, it’s not right.
Delightful: Every new feature needs to have some
amount of fun and delight. We might not need the most
elaborate animations in the first iteration of a feature,
but there should always be a hint of the magic that
learners love.
Polished: This is what makes a feature feel complete.
Tight visual design, perfect copy, and seamless
interactions are the baseline. Nothing should feel clunky
or inconsistent. For instance, we shouldn’t have both a
Back button and an X button that do the same thing.In product and design, there are four elements that guide us:
28 29

# ページ 17

The Bar for Hiring
Our people set the bar for everything else we do.
So, we insist on bringing in exceptional talent—
individuals who stand out not just in their skills but in
their character. That might mean someone who was
at the top of their class, or the first from their family
to graduate from college—but also is genuinely kind.
To maintain this standard, Luis and Severin still
approve every new hire.
We don’t lower this bar for anyone. For example, we
once passed on a senior executive for a role we had
been trying to fill for over a year because they weren’t
kind. They aced their interviews and had a strong
resume but were disrespectful to the driver who
picked them up from the airport. That single moment
told us what we needed to know. Excellence isn’t just
what you do—it’s how you treat others.V1s Not MVPs
The idea of shipping unfinished features, or Minimum Viable
Products (MVPs), is common across tech. But MVPs come with a
specific set of expectations—and limitations.
At Duolingo, we don’t do MVPs—we do V1s.
The difference is important: MVPs often have a lower standard
of quality and can be used as an excuse to ship subpar work. V1s,
on the other hand, are polished. They may not have all the bells
and whistles, but they meet our bar. Sometimes this approach
takes a little longer, but we refuse to compromise our users’
experience by showing them half-baked ideas.

When Duolingo was
starting out, we were
all sitting in one room.
We didn’t have formal Product Reviews, or OKRs, or
any of the structure we have today. There was no
blueprint because no other learning app was doing
what we were trying to do. We were—for better or
worse—making things up as we went along.
We were also fast as hell. And the pace of our
experimentation allowed us to quickly figure out what
was working, and ditch what wasn’t. This applied
across everything: product, hiring, engineering, and
our business as a whole. We were testing and learning
at warp speed.It’s still like this even today. We ship new versions of our iOS
and Android apps every week. And we’re running hundreds of
experiments* across the company at any given time. Duolingo
goes nowhere without this principle. “Ship It” keeps us ahead of
our competitors; “Ship It” makes Duolingo a fun place to work;
“Ship It” ensures that our product never sits still.
Go, Go, Go!
Duolingo is the sum of thousands of experiments. The faster
we can run experiments—successful or not—the faster we
can improve the app and advance our mission. Over time, each
of these changes builds on one another, creating a cycle of
compounding growth.
Shipping fast also lets us avoid lengthy debates and guesswork
about what we should be doing. That’s because testing in
the real world gives us better information than any internal
discussion ever could. So, we move quickly—to start these
feedback loops and let real data guide our work.
Clock Speed
“Clock speed” is a mindset that drives how we work. The concept
comes from microprocessor technology, where clock speed
measures how quickly a system can process instructions. We use
the term to talk about minimizing the gaps between actions: the
time between when a decision is made and when it’s implemented,
or when feedback is given and changes are made.
Experiments: Experiments are tests to see what works and what doesn’t. A/B tests are
a specific type of experiment where we simultaneously run two or more options against
one another.
34 35

# ページ 20

Ruthless Prioritization
As much as we want to move fast and increase clock
speed, we always need to make sure we’re working
on the right thing. At Duolingo, prioritization is
sometimes described as “ruthless:” we are decisive
about what we focus on as a company, based on what
will have the largest impact on our learners.
Deciding what to prioritize starts with clearly defined
goals. For every initiative, we ask: How does this
contribute to our mission? What measurable outcomes
will it drive? And if something doesn’t move the needle
in a meaningful way, it’s cut—no matter how much
effort has already gone into it. One high-impact win
always outweighs a handful of small scattered efforts.Increasing clock speed helps us reduce idle time and
make sure that the most important projects actually
get done. We should almost never have to wait a
month to see the next iteration of a project. The more
we can close these gaps, the faster we ship it, and
the faster we can learn and improve. It’s not about
rushing—it’s about never letting a break in the chain
slow us down.This mindset extends to our product. We cut features that don’t
deliver value, remove unnecessary complexity, and stay laser-
focused on our mission. Letting go of what’s not effective is often
as powerful as creating something new.
PR: Product Review. The meeting where we green-light every
change to the app. Led by the Product Org, but anyone can listen in!Shipping the Org
As teams grow and become more specialized, there’s a risk that our product will mirror the
organization’s structure rather than delivering a seamless experience for learners. This
is called “shipping the org.” For example, the tabs across the app—like Leaderboards and
Profile—are managed by different teams, each with distinct goals. Over time, this has led
to inconsistencies in their design. To counter this, we always need to consider the holistic
experience across the app.
37 36

# ページ 21

Culture of Experimentation The Right Amount of Process
“Ship It” isn’t just about speed; it’s about creating
as many opportunities as possible to learn and
improve. We like to play around, run a little wild—and
sometimes fail. But each experiment brings us closer
to seeing what works.As Duolingo grows, staying agile becomes more challenging. We
need guardrails and processes to keep things from spiraling out
of control, but we also want to avoid unnecessary red tape. The
question is: How can we add the right processes without slowing
ourselves down?
Good processes should reduce workloads, improve quality, and
lead to better decisions. One example of this is Product Review
(PR). In the early days, Luis often made product decisions
during informal meetings, which sometimes got messy. Not all
stakeholders were included or informed; even worse, it wasn’t
always clear if decisions were binding or if Luis was just musing.
We needed a better approach.
Taking inspiration from engineering’s code review process, we
introduced a formal structure for Product Review. Today, PR
ensures that everyone is clear on what decisions were made, and
that all relevant stakeholders are informed. The meeting also
includes a rotating group of leaders from Product and Design
who weigh in, ensuring diverse perspectives.
The success of PR has set a precedent for other teams.
Marketing, for instance, has adopted a Marketing Review, which
brings the same clarity and alignment to their campaigns. These
processes help us maintain our quality bar—and make faster
and visible decisions across the company.99 Bad Ideas
Some of our best features and campaigns have come
from asking ridiculous, unlikely questions. We practice
this at leadership offsites during a tradition we call
“99 Bad Ideas,” where we brainstorm outrageous
concepts—like Duo’s latest hijinks, or changing our
stock ticker to LILY.
But this spirit extends across the organization,
where we make space for challenging assumptions
and asking bold questions. What if you could talk
with Duolingo characters? What would Duo do with
five seconds at the Super Bowl? What if language
certification tests could be taken at home? Over
the years, these types of questions have helped us
consistently uncover new opportunities to delight our
learners and advance our mission.
Navigating Trade-offs
There’s a natural tension between “Raise the Bar” and “Ship It.” When they clash, our mission
is a great guide. The question is: How will this decision improve education and make it more
accessible? Often, it means letting go of perfection. Generative AI, for example, lets us create
content at a speed and scale we never thought possible. Early versions aren’t perfect, but they
deliver value to millions now—and the quality will improve over time.

that is grounded in data and real impact.PRINCIPLE #4

“Show Don’t Tell” means
we lead with the results
of our work, not the
story of its effort.
This approach is different from how most of us were
taught. In school or past jobs, we often learned to
communicate to persuade—selling ourselves with
pitches and stories. While those skills have their
place, they’re not how we uncover the truth, solve
problems, or build great things.  Numbers Are the Story
TL;DRMetrics, when available, should be at the center of all our work
and communications. Decisions must be grounded in evidence,
not abstract narratives.
By focusing on actual results—like the effect of a new feature
on daily bookings—we can quickly assess whether something
belongs in the app. But this spirit extends well beyond the app.
For example, we measure how our offices are being used (and
not used), so we can make each new space better than the last.
One key way we Show Don’t Tell is through TL;DRs—executive
summaries at the top of any important communication. We use
them in many places, from feature performance analyses and
meeting prereads to new policy announcements.
Crafting strong TL;DRs boosts the chances that your work will
be seen and remembered. They make complex information more
digestible and, importantly, encourage clearer thinking. To
write a TL;DR, you have to distill your message down to its most
essential points.
The Tyranny of Metrics
Fixating on the numbers can sometimes lead us astray. Metrics are valuable, but in
isolation, they paint an incomplete picture. For example, learning outcomes—that
is, what a student should know after completing a lesson—are notoriously tricky to
measure. In cases like these, we have to trust our intuition and expertise.

Say Less
Ideas Before EgosPrototypes, Not Pitch Decks
Great Products Don’t Have to Explain ThemselvesTalking about ideas is rarely as effective as building
them. Prototypes allow us to bring concepts to life,
align on a shared vision, and move forward quickly.
They’re especially important when dealing with
complex challenges like integrating AI into an
existing feature.And the actual learning is shaped by this principle, too.
Research shows that the most effective learning comes through
experience, not a long list of instructions. Rather than explaining
grammar rules, for example, we demonstrate language patterns
through interactive exercises and engaging visuals.
Great ideas don’t need a sales pitch—they need a chance
to prove themselves. At Duolingo, we prioritize results over
opinions. By empowering teams to explore bold concepts and
letting metrics guide the way, we ensure that the best ideas rise
to the top.
Our app is designed to be intuitive. Instead of telling
learners how to use Duolingo with pop-over messages
and lengthy onboarding flows, we let design, animation,
and simple prompts do the “showing.” When you open
up Duolingo for the first (or hundredth) time, the
learning experience should require no instructions.
That way, you can actually focus on learning.
Celebrating Innovators
We tend to be team first. But there are select moments when individual work that goes
above and beyond must be celebrated. Each year at Duoversary, we pick out a few standout
contributors and give them the Duolingo Innovation Award.

Disagree and Commit
The Trust BatteryDisagreements are inevitable, but here, we handle
them by taking action instead of getting stuck. When
two parties disagree, both commit to moving forward
with a decision and letting the results speak for
themselves. For example, even when someone like
Luis has doubts about an idea, they’ll often say, “Go
ahead and test it—let’s see what happens.” (This is
exactly what occurred with Leaderboards—now a key
feature on the app.)
This mindset extends beyond product. On our social
media team, for example, junior team members are
trusted to run with bold ideas and measure their
impact. By creating space for experimentation, we
ensure that outcomes—not opinions—lead the way.
Building trust is an essential part of this approach.
At Duolingo, trust isn’t assumed—it’s earned. Through
impactful work, everyone powers their Trust Battery.
Whether you’re an intern or a new executive, you
start by demonstrating your value with meaningful
contributions. Each contribution charges the
battery, creating a reserve of trust that strengthens
collaboration, decision-making, and accountability
over time.

We bring a sense of humor, joy, and
imagination to everything we do.  PRINCIPLE #5

Learning doesn’t have
to be boring, and
neither does work.
There’s a palpable sense of humor when you enter the
world of Duolingo. This isn’t a culture of poker faces
and formalities. It’s a world where gigantic, plush owls
star in fake Broadway musicals—on ice. Where any
wild idea is on the table, like an April Fools campaign
to sell language-learning toilet paper. Where no one is
safe from the joke (not even the CEO).A Product Built on Play
You Can Be More Than One ThingThere are lots of ways to teach a language. But none of them
work if learners aren’t engaged.
From the beginning, we made the decision to gamify the app.
Over time, we’ve expanded this by introducing more and more
engagement mechanics that keep learners coming back to
further their progress. But these tactics aren’t the only thing
that sets us apart.
Duolingo feels like an entirely different universe from traditional
education tools. Strange, unexpected things happen here.
Lessons are formatted like talk shows and video games;
sentences like “Your bear is drinking beer” verge on the absurd,
and the character Lily sarcastically supports your progress with
a slow clap. These moments of delight—characters, animations,
absurd surprises—do more than entertain; they play a key role
in keeping learners engaged.
Duolingo doesn’t fit neatly into one category. We’re not a game,
but we’re not just an education product either. Along that blurry
line lies the magic. The fact is, we’re competing with platforms
like TikTok, Instagram, and online games for attention, so we
have to make learning as fun as any of them. These platforms
are designed to keep people endlessly scrolling and watching.
What sets Duolingo apart is that our users come with a clear
goal: learning. It’s not mindless entertainment; it’s a productive
and purposeful use of your time. And the fun, the unexpected
moments, and the quirky design are what make you stay.

Quirky Culture
Open Doors
Joy by DesignAt some companies, there is a room at the end of the
hall with a giant mahogany table where all the real
decisions are made. It’s not like that here. (In fact,
Luis’s go-to conference room is a public fishbowl.)
We’re open about the most important issues at the
company—even ones that other places might try to
keep quiet. Q&A with Luis is one space where this
transparency is obvious. But more generally across
Duolingo, we make a point of being available: even our
most senior leaders are one DM away. Anyone at the
company can attend Product Review. This openness
and transparency set the conditions for taking risks
and getting weird.  This reaches a peak during our annual winter Getaway, when the
entire company decamps to Cancun without agendas or panels
or training sessions. The goal is simple: give Duos a low-pressure
space to connect and unwind. We believe that when we genuinely
enjoy our working environment and each other’s company, work
becomes better, in all senses of the word.
Our product is fun because of the people who build
it. It’s obvious to anyone who walks into the office:
on any given day, you might see a human-size Duo
practicing calisthenics in the atrium, or stumble upon
one of more than 100 clubs devoted to everything
from crossword puzzles to oysters. Maybe you’re
around in October and catch the annual Pittsburgh
Puppy Parade. None of this is by accident. A great
culture is hard to build, easy to lose, and essential for
our success.  Respect Boundaries
The reason we can be goofy and experiment without judgment is because we have a
baseline of care and respect within the company. With a diverse team of backgrounds,
experiences, and perspectives, it’s important to be thoughtful—what’s funny to one
person might not land for another. Everyone here is an adult, and we expect you to
respect people’s boundaries.

Wholesome and Unhinged
Committing to the BitApril Fools
Duality of DuoOver the years, we've experimented with different formats, tones,
and design languages—eventually landing on our unique brand:
wholesome and unhinged.  By leaning into the joke, Duo has become a bona fide viral
sensation. He’s shown up everywhere from Saturday Night Live
to popular video games and celebrity Instagrams. There are
galaxies of crazy memes, from Buff Duo to Anime Duo and more.
It took some time to find our voice, especially with our external
marketing. Early on, we tried to appeal to the broadest possible
audience, but we ended up with nothing distinctive to say. And
in marketing, there’s nothing worse than being bland. So we
changed tack, and our approach to marketing became weird,
unexpected, and often funny.
Humor doesn’t scale perfectly. It’s subjective, sometimes
polarizing. So to unleash the full power of Duo humor, we had to
accept that not everyone would get the joke. What truly matters
is that people who do get it love it—and we do everything we can
to nurture that passion.April Fools is the perfect holiday for Duolingo: everything is
fair game for a joke, and the further you push it, the better. We
realized in the early years of the company that April Fools stunts
were a great way to generate buzz and celebrate our quirky sense
of humor. Our earliest experiments, like the Duolingo Pillow, have
evolved into full-scale campaigns—like 2024’s Duolingo on Ice,
which garnered 100 million social media impressions.
Our mascot was initially designed to encourage regular practice.
But once the internet got their hands on him, he grew into a
more complicated—even menacing—character with his own
lore. He’s still cute and cuddly. But he’s also willing to temporarily
relocate your family to ensure you finish your lessons.

Five Seconds with Duo
Super Bowl LVIII. 200 million viewers are watching around the
world. All of a sudden, a bright green owl shoots another owl out
of his butt, reminding you to "Do your Duolingo."
It wasn’t your typical Super Bowl ad—but it couldn’t have been
more Duolingo.
Those five seconds, which aired on February 11, 2024, were the
culmination of months of collaboration across a half dozen
teams. We didn’t want to pay for a 30-second spot, so we gave
ourselves a challenge: How could we make a splash in just five?
We knew that every pixel mattered. There wasn’t time for flash
or filler, so we embraced the quirky, unhinged, unexpected
nature of Duo himself. When debates broke out over the “right
amount of butt” to show, we knew we had a winning idea.
The gamble paid off. For a fraction of the cost, our ad generated
as much buzz as any other Super Bowl ad that year, and
appeared on multiple “best of” lists. It was playful, unexpected,
and didn’t take itself too seriously—exactly the formula that has
driven our success as a brand.

Our Process
By this point, we’ve covered a lot about our principles—their
history, why we have them, and what they mean. The Green
Machine is a framework for putting them to work.
This approach emerged organically during our earliest days as a
startup and has been refined every year since. (Along the way, it
has produced some of our most valuable innovations and biggest
wins.) You can think of The Green Machine as a process of
continuous improvement through small changes. When a small
change improves metrics, we make more changes like that.
In its most basic form, the Green Machine goes like this: gather
excellent people, give them space to experiment, and then double
down on what works.
If you're working on something, and you're stuck, check it
against these six steps. Maybe it's faltering because you didn't
think carefully enough about your team, or because you don’t
have the proper feedback loops. The Green Machine model can
help just about any project get on track.  Our principles provide the theory.
The Green Machine puts that
theory into practice.

The Green Machine: Six Steps
1. Staff It with Great People
2. Define Success
3. Set Guardrails and Think Long-Term4. Build the Thing and Set Up Feedback Loops
5. Execute with Urgency and Excellence
6. Double Down on What Works, Stop What Doesn’tGreat experiments require exceptional teams who can quickly
brainstorm ideas, execute, and pivot on a dime. This is why we
set such a high bar in hiring and invest so much in our people.
We like to keep teams lean and scrappy to start, only adding
more people once we see success.
We always want to set clear, measurable goals—whether it’s
DAUs, bookings, or social impressions. But metrics aren’t always
available for early-stage projects. In that case, we define the best
available qualitative goals, iterate toward clarity, and keep an eye
out for any useful signals.
We use guardrails to ensure our work benefits both Duolingo
and our learners over the long term. This aligns with our core
principle, Take the Long View. Thoughtful guardrails help us
focus on sustainable, meaningful growth, ensuring that each
experiment serves a greater purpose.The fastest way to create something excellent isn’t through
abstract discussions. Just start building, and create the right
continuous feedback loops. This feedback comes from both
quantitative (A/B test results, social impressions, efficacy
research) and qualitative sources (extensive dogfooding). Early-
stage projects typically lean more heavily on qualitative feedback
before shifting to more data-driven metrics.
Because of the compounding nature of smaller improvements,
there is a huge cost to moving slowly. But moving too fast
can also lead to sloppy outcomes. In step five, we work to
continuously (and urgently) ship work that meets our bar.
When something is working, we allocate more resources and
keep working on it (sometimes for years). But we need to be
comfortable sunsetting projects or even entire products that
don’t demonstrate success.
Part of the Plan
Crucially, the Green Machine is not a replacement for planning. We still have quarterly
OKRs, annual goals, and a long-range financial plan. The difference is that we don’t rely
on multi-year roadmaps for the app.
