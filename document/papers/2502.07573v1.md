Abstract
Gauge origami is a generalized supersymmetric gauge theory defined on several intersecting space-time components.
It provides a systematic way to consider generalizations of instantons. In this thesis, we explore the gauge origami
system in R1,1×C4and its BPS/CFT correspondence. String theoretically, instantons of the gauge origami system
arise from D0-branes bound to D (2p)-branes wrapping cycles in C4. The low energy theory of the D0-branes is
understood as an N= 2 supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanical system and the Witten index of it produces
the instanton partition function. We define a q-deformed quiver Cartan matrix associated to this quiver structure and
introduce vertex operators associated with the D-branes and show that the contour integral formula for the Witten index
has a nice free field realization. Such free field realization leads to the concept of BPS qq-characters or BPS quiver W-
algebras, which are generalizations of the conventional deformed W-algebras. The qq-characters of D2 and D4-branes
correspond to screening charges and generators of the affine quiver W-algebra, respectively. On the other hand, the
qq-characters of D6 and D8-branes represent novel types of qq-characters, where monomial terms are characterized
by plane partitions and solid partitions. The composition of these qq-characters yields the instanton partition functions
of the gauge origami system, eventually establishing the BPS/CFT correspondence. Additionally, we demonstrate
that the fusion of qq-characters of D-branes in lower dimensions results in higher-dimensional D-brane qq-characters.
We also investigate quadratic relations among these qq-characters. Furthermore, we explore the relationship with the
representations of the quantum toroidal gl1.

Introduction
Rise of BPS/CFT correspondence Towards a non-perturbative understanding of string theory and quantum field
theory, exact computations of physical observables have played significant roles. Among these observables, the instan-
ton partition functions of supersymmetric gauge theories have emerged as significant quantities that can be precisely
computed through localization techniques [Nek02, NO03, NY03a, NY03b, NY05, Pes07, PZ+16]. These partition
functions exhibit remarkable characteristics, particularly in the realm of rich geometric and algebraic properties. Our
specific interest lies in the algebraic structures of these partition functions, which have, in turn, led to the revelation
of a novel duality known as the BPS/CFT correspondence [Nak99, NPS13, Nek15, Nek16, Nek17a, Nek17b, Nek17c,
Nek17d, NP18]. The BPS/CFT correspondence claims that correlation functions of BPS observables in supersymmet-
ric gauge theories are dual to correlation functions of infinite-dimensional algebras. A well-known example of this
duality is the Alday–Gaiotto–Tachikawa (AGT) duality [Gai09, AGT09, Wyl09] (see also [LF20] for a review), which
established a connection between instanton partition functions of 4d N= 2theories and conformal blocks of 2d con-
formal field theories (CFT), where both theories originate from a 6d N= (2,0)theory compactified on a Riemann
surface. A 5d lift-up of the AGT duality called the 5d AGT duality [AY09, AY10, Tak14], was subsequently discov-
ered and the partition functions are dual to correlation functions of quantum algebras. Over the last decade, efforts
have been dedicated to generalizing both the gauge theory side and the infinite-dimensional algebra side to achieve a
more comprehensive understanding of the BPS/CFT correspondence [Mik07, FJMM10, LS16, GR17, PR17, PR18,
RSYZ18, RSYZ20, LY20, GLY21b, NW21a].
Generalized gauge theory The usual instantons appear as topologically nontrivial field configurations minimizing
the action of the Yang–Mills theory on R4and the moduli space comes from the ADHM construction [AHDM78,
AB84]. After introducing a nontrivial background flux called Ω-background, Nekrasov showed that the instanton
partition function takes the form of Z=P
λq|λ|Z[λ]where the terms are a summation of two-dimensional partitions
[LNS98, MNS97, Nek02, NO03]. Over the last few years, researches on generalizations of the Yang–Mills instantons
have been conducted and we now know that there are higher dimensional generalizations of instantons having ADHM-
like constructions [AOS97, BKS97, Nek09, ST22, Nek23]. The instanton partition functions are given as a statistical
sum of random partitions as Z=P
Λq|Λ|Z[Λ], where Λis a random partition. Considering 6d and 8d theories, the
random partitions Λwill be plane partitions [Jaf07, CSS08, Nek09, AK09] and solid partitions [Nek17d, NP18], re-
spectively (see also [Kan20]). In type IIB string theory on R10, such kind of setup appears as the low energy limit of the
worldvolume theory of the D1-branes probing the D (2p+ 1) -branes (p= 2,3,4)[Wit94, Wit95, Dou95, Dou96]: 2d
(p= 2), 3d ( p= 3), 4d(p= 4) partitions. Mathematically, the p= 3case gives the equivariant Donaldson–Thomas
invariants of C3, while the p= 4 case is called the magnificent four model and gives the equivariant Donaldson–
Thomas invariants of C4.
Another direction of generalizations of the Yang–Mills instantons is the generalized gauge theory [Nek15, Nek16,
Nek17a], which is a theory defined on several, generally, intersecting components as S=S
iSiwhere on each
space-time component Sithere is an original field theory. On each space-time component Si, we have a gauge group
Giand at the intersection Si∩ Sjwe have bifundamental fields transforming under Gi×Gj, and thus it could be
understood as a generalized quiver gauge theory. From the viewpoint of each field theory on Si, the intersection of
other components plays the role of defects. The first example of such general gauge theory is the so-called spiked

instanton system, which was introduced in [Nek15, Nek16]. The spiked instantons arise from the low energy limit of
D1-branes probing intersecting D5 (and anti-D5)-branes. Later, it was generalized to D1-branes probing intersecting
D7-branes in [PYZ21] (see also [FM23, CZ23]), and the arising instantons are called the tetrahedron instantons. Note
that these instantons are generalizations of the higher dimensional instantons introduced in the previous paragraph.
Gauge origami The setups discussed previously are collectively called the gauge origami and the arising partition
function is called the gauge origami partition function [Nek17a]. Consider a type IIB theory on Z× C where Zis a
toric Calabi–Yau four-fold and C=C,C×,T2and the low energy limit of the D1-branes probing D (2p+ 1) -branes.
The D1-branes wrap Cwhile the D (2p+ 1) -branes wrap the product of Cand non-compact toric submanifolds of Z
in a way preserving a suitable number of supersymmetries. Depending on C, the arising partition function becomes
rational, trigonometric, and elliptic, respectively. The gauge origami partition function generally takes the form as1
Z折紙=X
{Λ(α)
i}q|⃗Λ|Y
(i,α)Z[Λ(α)
i]Y
(i,α)̸=(j,β)Z(Λ(α)
i|Λ(β)
j)(1.0.1)
where ilabels the possible types of toric submanifolds and αlabels the number of D-branes wrapping them. The
partition function is a summation of random BPS crystals , which are generalizations of the partitions, and they are
denoted Λ(α)
i. These crystals are expected to be, generally, truncations of four-dimensional BPS crystals which are
generalizations of the three-dimensional BPS crystals [Sze07, MR08, OY08, NN08] (see [BSY24, Fra23] for recent
discussions). The Z[Λ(α)
i]part comes from the contribution of each D (2p+ 1) -branes while the Z(Λ(α)
i|Λ(β)
j)part
comes from the bifundamental contributions at the junctions. In this paper, we mainly focus on the case when Z=C4
andC=C×≃R×S1which gives the K-theoretic magnificent four [Nek17d, NP18], tetrahedron instanton [PYZ21],
and spiked instanton [NP16] setups. From the string theory viewpoint, we take the T-duality of the D1–D (2p+ 1)
system and consider a D 0–D(2p)system, where each D (2p)-brane gives a (2p+ 1)-dimensional gauge theory and the
D0-branes play the roles of instantons.
Quantum algebra of gauge origami An interesting property of the gauge origami partition function is the existence
of an infinite set of non-perturbative Dyson–Schwinger equations related to the symmetries of adding and removing
instantons [Nek15]. The qq-characters are physical observables characterizing them, and interestingly, there is an
operator formalism of them called the quiver W-algebra [KP15, KP16, KP17, KP19b] (see [Kim20] for a review).
From the gauge theoretic viewpoint, such algebras are associated with the Dynkin diagram corresponding to the
quiver structure of the gauge theory. In the gauge origami formalism, the qq-characters and quiver W-algebras appear
from the gauge origami system in Z=C2×C2/Γ, where Γdenotes the finite subgroup of SU(2) associated with
the quiver structure through the McKay correspondence. Placing D 4-branes wrapping the C2part gives the 5d N= 1
(affine) quiver gauge theories and the D 4-branes wrapping the C2/Γgive the qq-characters or the quiver W-algebras
of the theory. Physically, they are codimension four defects of the quiver gauge theory [Kim16].
One of the reasons why such algebras are considered important is because they give the BPS/CFT correspondence
for the present case. One can construct screening currents from the quiver structure and the vacuum expectation value
of them gives the instanton partition function of the quiver gauge theory. Moreover, after defining the highest weight,
the commutativity with the screening charges determines the generator of the quiver W-algebra uniquely and they are
the operator version of the qq-characters. These quiver W-algebras include the well-known q-Virasoro [SKAO95],
q-WN[AKOS95, AKOS96], and Frenkel–Reshetkhin’s deformed W-algebras [FR97, FR98].
Although the quiver W-algebras indeed gave a way to discuss the BPS/CFT correspondence from the quantum alge-
braic viewpoint, the applicable theory is still limited and needs to be extended. For example, while the qq-characters as-
sociated with Z=C2/Υ×C2/Γwere studied in terms of partition functions in [NP12, NPS13, Nek15, JN18, JLN21],
it seems that the complete operator formalism of such cases is still missing in the literature. Moreover, the quiver W-
algebra is only applicable to discuss two stacks of D-branes in transverse directions while we have multiple intersecting
D-branes in the gauge origami system. Based on recent studies such as the tetrahedron instanton system we also have
D-branes wrapping not only complex two-dimensional surfaces but also complex three-dimensional manifolds. Most
importantly, we need to generalize the operator formalism to describe gauge origami systems associated with general
toric Calabi–Yau four-folds Z. See [CKM19, Kim22b, CKM23, ST23, NP23] for discussions along this direction.

11 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
The goal of this thesis is to fill in this gap by generalizing the concept of quiver W-algebras and showing the
BPS/CFT correspondence of the gauge origami system associated with C4. Some generalizations to toric Calabi–Yau
four-folds were already proposed in [KN23] (see also [BSY24, Fra23]) but in this thesis we focus only on C4.
Organization and summary of this thesis
The rest of this thesis consists of six chapters and five appendices. Chap. 2, 3, 4 are preliminaries while Chap. 5
and 6 are the original part which are based on the author’s papers [KN23, KN24]. Appendix A, B, C, D, and E are
supplementary materials.
In Chap. 2, we review basic aspects of instanton counting and supersymmetric localization using the pure super
Yang–Mills theory as a toy model. The ADHM data, contour integral formulas, JK residues and Nekrasov factors
are reviewed there. In Chap. 3, we move on to the gauge origami system and discuss generalizations of the ADHM
instantons. Such instantons appear in string theory as low energy limits of D1-branes probing the D( 2p+ 1)-branes.
We discuss the number of preserved supersymmetries, open string spectrum, and show that the low energy limit of
the D1-branes can be described by a 2d N= (0,2)quiver gauge theory. Moreover, we show that the vacuum moduli
space of such quiver gauge theories give the instanton moduli space. We then take the T-duality and consider the 1d
N= 2supersymmetric quantum mechanics and evaluate the Witten index in Chap. 4. Similar to the pure SYM case,
after evaluation of the contour integral formulas, the poles are classified by multi-dimensional partitions, which are
generalizations of Young diagrams. We also study the properties of the gauge origami partition functions. In Chap. 5,
we propose a systematical way to define vertex operators reproducing the contour integral formulas of a 1d N= 2
supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics. The data of these vertex operators are all encoded in a matrix which we
callqquiver Cartan matrix (see section 5.1 for the definitions). This matrix includes the information of the quiver
diagram and the associated flavor charges of the matter components in the low energy field theory. We then apply this
formalism to the gauge origami system and derive the free field realizations of the contour integral formulas. Such free
field realization implies the existence of a quantum algebraic structure. In Chap. 6, we introduce the BPS qq-characters
and show the BPS/CFT correspondence of the gauge origami system. Furthermore, we study the quantum algebraic
properties of these BPS qq-characters. Finally, in Chap. 7, we give the conclusion.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 12
Definition of D-brane vertex operators We introduce vertex operators A(x),Sa(x),XA(x),W¯a(x),Z(x)corre-
sponding to D0, D2, D4, D6, and D8-branes wrapping the possible subspaces pt, Ca,C2
A,C3
¯a,C4(a∈4, A∈6),
respectively. The main result of section 5.2 is as follows.2
Theorem 1.0.2 (Thm. 5.2.1) .For each D-brane (D0, D2, D4, D6, D8), we define the corresponding vertex operators
as
D-brane space-time vertex operator
D0-brane pt ×S1A(x)
D2-brane Ca×S1(a∈4) Sa(x)
D4-brane C2
A×S1(A∈6) XA(x)
D6-brane C3
¯a×S1(a∈4) W¯a(x)
D8-brane C4×S1Z(x)(1.0.3)
We have multiple copies of vertex operators if there are multiple ways that the D-branes can wrap. Then, the contour
integral formula of the k-instanton partition function takes the form as
Zk=Gk
k!IkY
I=1dxI
2πixI⟨0|kY
I=1A(xI)−1:Y
iVi(vi) :|0⟩, (1.0.4)
where Vi(x)is an operator written from {XA(x),W¯a(x),Z(x)}.
Operator formalism of qq-characters We introduce the operator formalism of the qq-characters of the gauge
origami system and show the BPS/CFT correspondence. For each D (2p)-brane, we can associate a qq-character.
The D2 qq-characters Qa(x) (a∈4)are four copies of the screening charge of the bA0quiver W-algebra [KP15]
and the D4 qq-characters TA(x) (A∈6)are six copies of the generator of the bA0quiver W-algebra. The D6 qq-
characters T¯a(x) (a∈4)are the new qq-characters where the monomial terms are labeled by plane partitions. These
qq-characters represent the quantum algebras associated with complex 1,2,3-dimensional submanifolds. We will see
that their compositions indeed give the gauge origami partition function which shows the BPS/CFT correspondence.
Theorem 1.0.3 (Thm. 6.2.7, 6.3.7) .The gauge origami partition function is in general given as a correlation function
of the qq-characters,
Z折紙=⟨0|Y
(i,α)Ti(xi,α)|0⟩(1.0.5)
where itakes values in i∈4∨,6andi= 1234 .
In the context of quiver W-algebra and also the quantum integrable system, the commutation relation between the
vertex operators plays a fundamental role. We obtain an interesting commutativity among qq-characters: The D2,
D4, D6 qq-characters associated with subspaces of C4that are transverse with each other commutes. We also give a
conjecture claiming that the D6 and D8 qq-characters all commute with each other.
Theorem 1.0.4 (Thm. 6.3.5) .Theqq-characters associated with the elements i, j∈4⊕6⊕4∨commute with each
other up to trivial zero modes (see (6.2.46)) when iandjare transverse with each other:
Ti(x)Tj(x′)−fij(x, x′)Tj(x′)Ti(x) = 0 ⇐⇒ i∩j=∅, (1.0.6)
where fij(x, x′)are zero mode factors.
Conjecture 1.0.5 (Conj. 6.4.8) .The quadratic relations of the D8 qq-characters are
fK2|K1
44 (x2/x1)TK1
4(x1)TK2
4(x2)−fK1|K2
44 (x1/x2)TK2
4(x2)TK1
4(x1) = 0 , (1.0.7)
2In this thesis, we only focus on the D4, D6, and D8 cases. Discussion on the D2-branes are left for future work.

where K1, K2are arbitrary. Moreover, this commutativity uniquely determines the sign factor (−1)σ4(ρ)up to a global

ADHM theory and supersymmetric
localization
Yang–Mills instantons are topologically nontrivial field configurations minimizing the Yang–Mills action. ADHM
constructions give a systematical way to construct instantons and the instanton moduli space is encoded in the ADHM
data. With suitable number of supersymmetries, we can explicitly compute the instanton partition functions. In this
chapter, we review basic aspects of instanton counting and supersymmetric localization using the pure super Yang–
Mills (SYM) as a toy model. For a reviews, see for example [PZ+16] or [Sha05] (see also [NY03b]).
We first review basic facts for instantons and supersymmetric localization in section 2.1. We then give the ADHM
data and discuss that the moduli space is constructed from the ADHM equations in section 2.2. Studying the sym-
metries of the moduli space, we provide the so-called LMNS formula which is a contour integral formula giving
thek-instanton contribution. In section 2.3, we discuss on how to evaluate the contour integral using the JK-residue
formalism. We will see that the poles are classified by Young diagrams. Finally, in section 2.4, we provide residue
formulas and explicitly evaluate the residues.
2.1 Yang–Mills theory and instantons
Let us briefly review what a gauge theory is. Let Gbe a Lie group, where in this thesis it is taken to be a unitary group
G= U( n). We denote g= Lie( G)as the Lie algebra. We take the space-time to be Euclidean. The gauge field Aµ
is ag-valued one-form and the field strength is defined as F=dA+A∧A. The gauge transformation of them are
given as A7→gAg−1+gdg−1andF7→gFg−1forg∈G. The G-invariant action of the Yang–Mills (YM) theory
is defined as
SYM=−1
g2
YMZ
d4xTr(F∧⋆F), (2.1.1)
where ⋆is the Hodge dual. Given this Lagrangian, we are interested in field configurations minimizing the YM action
as
δSYM
δA= 0. (2.1.2)
Since the Hodge star acts as ⋆2= 1 on two-forms in four dimensions, we can decompose the field strength into
self-dual (SD) and anti-self-dual (ASD) parts, with respect to the eigenvalue of the Hodge star:
F±=1
2(F±⋆F). (2.1.3)
The vanishing conditions of the SD (ASD) part is the ASD (SD) YM equation: ⋆F=∓F. Fields obeying the ASD
(SD) equations are called the instantons (anti-instantons).
The action (2.1.1) is bounded by the SD, ASD YM equations:
SYM=−1

where the instanton number k∈Zis defined as
k=1
8π2Z
TrF∧F (2.1.5)
and the equality is at F=∓⋆ F. For the ASD (SD) YM equations, we have k≥0 (k≤0). We may also include the
θ-term as
Sθ=−iθ
2π2Z
d4xTrF∧F (2.1.6)
and the total action is given as Stot.=SYM+Sθ. The total action around the k-instanton contribution is schematically
expanded as
Stot.[A] =8π2

YM|k| −iθk+Sfluc.[δA] =Stop.[A] +Sfluc.[δA] (2.1.7)
withA=A(k)
inst.+δA. In this thesis, we are interested in the partition function defined as
Z=Z
[DA]e−Stot.. (2.1.8)
Explicitly computing this quantity is difficult but with the power of supersymmetry, the fluctuation part will be
suppressed and we can compute it explicitly using supersymmetric localization. Suppose that Sis an action of a
given theory and that we have a non-anomalous fermionic symmetry charge Q. We collectively denote Φas the field
variables. The charge Qobeys QS= 0 andQ2=Bwhere Bis some bosonic symmetry. Let Obe aQ-closed
operator and the vacuum expectation value of it is defined as
⟨O⟩=Z
[DΦ]e−S[Φ]O[Φ]. (2.1.9)
Choosing a functional V[Φ]such that BV= 0, we can add the localizing action Sloc.=QV[Φ]and deform the VEV
as
⟨O⟩(t) =Z
[DΦ]e−S[Φ]−tSloc.[Φ]O[Φ]. (2.1.10)
This VEV actually does not depend on t:
∂⟨O⟩(t)
∂t=−Z
[DX]QV[Φ]e−S[Φ]−tSloc.[Φ]O[Φ] =−Z
[DX]Q
V[Φ]e−S[Φ]−tSloc.[Φ]O[Φ]
= 0. (2.1.11)
We then have
⟨O⟩= lim
t→∞⟨O⟩(t). (2.1.12)
Note that the VEV of the operator does not change even if we add a Q-exact term. Moreover, the coupling constants
of such Q-exact terms do not depend. Using this property, taking the limit t→ ∞ fields obeying Sloc.[Φ0] = 0 only
remain and we can expand the fields around Φ0as
Φ = Φ 0+t−1/2˜Φ (2.1.13)
and we have
S[Φ] + tQV[Φ] = S[Φ0] +Z
˜Φδ2Sloc.[Φ]
δΦ2
Φ=Φ 0˜Φ!
+O(t−1/2). (2.1.14)
Thanks to this property, only quadratic terms in ˜Φwill appear in the VEV . Denoting the space of the fields obeying
the condition Sloc.[Φ0] = 0 asM, the VEV is then given as
⟨O⟩= lim
t→∞⟨O⟩(t) =Z

17 CHAPTER 2. ADHM THEORY AND SUPERSYMMETRIC LOCALIZATION
In particular, considering the 4d N= 2 pure super Yang–Mills theory with gauge group G= U( n), the action
schematically takes the form as
S=Stop.+QV. (2.1.16)
For the detailed expression, see for example [Sha05]. Expanding around the k-instanton configuration, the partition
function is then given by
Z=⟨1⟩=Z
[DΦ]e−Stop.−QV=Zpert.∞X

inst.] 1 (2.1.17)
where q=e2πiτand
τ=4πi

YM+θ
2π. (2.1.18)
The space Mn,kis the space of fields obeying the ASD YM equation with the topological number kand it is called the
instanton moduli space . The perturbative part Zpert.comes from the path integral of the quadratic terms coming from
the fluctuations around the saddle point. The instanton partition function is then defined by omitting the perturbative
part
Zinst.=∞X
k=0qkZk,Zk=Z
Mn,k1. (2.1.19)
2.2 ADHM data and LMNS formula
ADHM data To evaluate the instanton partition function, we need the information of the instanton moduli space
Mn,k. A systematic construction for instantons is known as the ADHM construction [AHDM78]. To construct the
k-instanton solution in G= U( n)Yang–Mills theory on R4=C2, we introduce two complex vector spaces
N=Cn,K=Ck(2.2.1)
and define
X= Hom( K,K)⊕Hom( K,K)⊕Hom( N,K)⊕Hom( K,N). (2.2.2)
The ADHM variables B1,2,I,Jare linear maps relating the vector spaces N,Kand are elements of X:
B1,2:K→K,I:N→K,J:K→N. (2.2.3)
The space Xhas a natural action coming from G= U( n)andG∨= U( k). The actions on the ADHM variables are
given as
G∨: (g)·(B1,2,I,J) = (gB1,2g−1, gI,Jg−1), g∈U(k),
G: (ν)·(B1,2,I,J) = ( B1,2,Iν−1, νJ), ν∈U(n).(2.2.4)
They play the role of the flavor symmetry of the ADHM variables. The latter symmetry corresponds to the gauge
transformation of the framing of the U(n)theory.3
Atiyah–Drinfeld–Hitchin–Manin identified that the k-instanton moduli space of the U(n)connection is identified
as the hyper-K ¨ahler quotient
Mn,k={(B1,B2,I,J)|(µR, µC) = (0 ,0)}/U(k) (2.2.5)
where µR, µCare the moment maps defined as
µR= [B1,B†
1] + [B2,B†
2] +II†−J†J,
µC= [B1,B2] +IJ.(2.2.6)
These equations (µR, µC) = (0 ,0)are called the ADHM equations.
3Since we are interested in instantons with finite action, the curvature needs to vanish at the infinity F→0implying a pure gauge A→gdg−1.
We still have a residual global symmetry here and it is called the framing of the gauge connection.

CHAPTER 2. ADHM THEORY AND SUPERSYMMETRIC LOCALIZATION 18
In addition to (2.2.4), we have another global symmetry preserving the ADHM equations (2.2.6) corresponding to
the spacetime rotation of the gauge theory on C2:
(q1, q2)·(B1,B2,I,J) = (q1B1, q2B2,I, q12J) (2.2.7)
where q1,2=eϵ1,2∈U(1)2,q12=q1q2=eϵ12, and ϵ12=ϵ1+ϵ2. Under this symmetry, the ADHM equations
transform as
µR→µR, µC→q12µC. (2.2.8)
The moduli space (2.2.5) itself is actually non-compact and singular. Naively, the volume of it will diverge and to
resolve this we can modify the ADHM equations as
Mζ
n,k=µ−1(ζ)/U(k) =s−1(0)/U(k) (2.2.9)
where µ= (µR,ReµC,ImµC),ζ= (ζ1k,0,0), and⃗ s=⃗ µ−⃗ζ(=s).
LMNS formula The integration over Mζ
n,kcan be written in a path integral over the variables which eventually
leads to a finite-dimensional integral. Let (ψB1,2, ψI, ψJ)be fermionic variables and (⃗ χ,⃗H),(λ, η)be the anti-ghost
multiplets. We define the BRST transformation as
QB1,2=ψ1,2,Qψ1,2= [ϕ,B1,2]−ϵ1,2B1,2,
QI=ψI,QψI=ϕI−Ia,
QJ=ψJ,QψJ=−Jϕ+aJ−ϵ12J,
QχR=HR,QHR= [ϕ, χR],
QχC=HC,QHC= [ϕ, χC]−ϵ12χC,
Qλ=η, Qη= [ϕ, λ](2.2.10)
where (ϕ,a, ϵ1,2)∈u(k),u(n),u(1)2. The equivariant integral over the ADHM variables is given as
Zk(a, ϵ1,2):=Z
Mn,k1 =Z

2]−I†λ¯ψI+¯ψJλJ†.(2.2.13)
Note that since this action is Q-exact, the path integral is independent of the coupling constants. To cure zero-modes
coming from χR, we may add another Q-exact term QTrKχRλ. We also can further introduce kinetic terms of
(B1,2,I,J)as

Using the property that the path integral does not depend on the coupling constants, at the end the resulting terms
only come from B1,2,I,J, χC(see for example [Sha05] for details of this computation). To see this, we first diagonalize
ϕasϕ= diag( ϕ1, . . . , ϕ k)and then the measure is given as

ϕ(ϕ−ϵ12). (2.2.18)
This is the famous Losev–Moore–Nekrasov–Shatashvili (LMNS) formula [LNS97, MNS97, LNS98].
Five-dimensional lift up Although we considered the 4d pure SYM defined on C2, we can also study the 5d lift up
version of it defined on C2×S1. There is a simple prescription to do this and it is to replace variables such as (ϕI−a)
tosh(ϕI−a)(see section 4.2 for motivations), where
sh(x):=ex/2−e−x/2. (2.2.19)
Physically, we are considering the supersymmetric quantum mechanics instead of the matrix model. The instanton
partition function for the 5d N= 1 U( n)pure super Yang–Mills theory is then given by
Z=∞X

(2.2.21)
In this thesis, we will be interested in these type of partition functions where trigonometric functions appear.
2.3 Jefferey–Kirwan residue and Young diagrams
The formula in (2.2.21) is a contour integral in multiple variables and we need to specify how to take the contour
integral to evaluate it explicitly [Nek02, Nak99, NY03b]. In this thesis, we use the Jefferey–Kirwan (JK) residue
prescription [JK93] (see [BEHT13a, BEHT13b] for a physical derivation of it). Since it is out of the scope of this
thesis, we will not give any reasoning why we should use this prescription, but we will simply use the formalism to
evaluate all the contour integral formulas appearing in this thesis.

For simplicity, we omit the 2πifactor in the denominator of dϕ. Denoting the singular hyperplane Hias
Hi={ϕ∈Ck|Qi·ϕ+bi= 0}, (2.3.3)
thenωis singular at Msing=S
iHiand holomorphic at the complement of it. We define M∗
singto be the set of
isolated points where n≥klinearly independent singular hyperplanes meet. When n=rhyperplanes meet the point
ϕ∗∈ M∗
sing, the intersection is called non-degenerate , while when n > r hyperplanes meet it, the intersection is called
degenerate . For ϕ∗∈ M∗
sing, we denote Q(ϕ∗)as the set of charge vectors of singular hyperplanes meeting at ϕ∗:
Q(ϕ∗) ={Qi|ϕ∗∈Hi, i= 1, . . . , n }. (2.3.4)
The hyperplane arrangements are called projective when the ncharge vectors Q(ϕ∗)are contained in the half space of
Rk. We assume that the hyperplane arrangements are projective, then the residue of ωatϕ∗is given as follows. Near
the pole ϕ∗, we can expand ωin negative powers of Qi·(ϕ−ϕ∗)giving linear combinations of
1
Q1·(ϕ−ϕ∗)···Qk·(ϕ−ϕ∗)(2.3.5)
for some kcharge vectors Q1, . . . ,QkinQ(ϕ∗). We denote the cone spanned by Q1, . . . ,Qkas
Cone( Q1, . . . ,Qk) =(kX
i=1λiQi=η|λi>0)
, (2.3.6)
where ηis some generic vector which we call the reference vector . In this thesis, we always keep it to be η=
(1, . . . , 1) =Pk
i=1ei. The JK-residue formula claims that the contour integral is given as
Z
ω=X
ϕ∗∈M∗
singJK-Res
ϕ=ϕ∗(Q(ϕ∗),η)ω(2.3.7)
where the JK-residue operator is defined as
JK-Res
ϕ=ϕ∗(Q(ϕ∗),η)dϕ1∧ ··· ∧ dϕkQk
i=1(Qi·(ϕ−ϕ∗))=(
|det(Q1, . . . ,Qk)|−1,η∈Cone( Q1, . . . ,Qk)
0, otherwise .(2.3.8)
Although the above description gives an explicit way to evaluate the residues of the contour integral, finding a way
to evaluate the integral recursively is useful. Actually, the JK residue can be equivalently given by a sum of iterated
residues [SV03]. For each ϕ∗with(Q1, . . . ,Qn), we consider a flag
F=
F0={0} ⊂ F 1⊂ F 2··· ⊂ F k=Rk
,dimFj=j (2.3.9)
where Fjis a vector space spanned by {Q1, . . . ,Qj}. Denote the set of flags as FL(Q(ϕ∗))and define the subset
FL+(Q(ϕ∗)) =
F ∈ FL (Q(ϕ∗))|η∈Cone( κF
1, . . . , κF
r)
, (2.3.10)
where
κF
j=X
Qi∈Q(ϕ∗)∩FjQi.(2.3.11)
We also define the sign of F, denoted as sgnF, as the sign of the determinant of the matrix
κ(F,Q(ϕ∗)) = ( κF
1, . . . , κF
r). (2.3.12)
The JK residue is then obtain by an iterated residue :

while variables ϕj(j > i)are kept generic.
The JK-residue formalism discussed above is quite abstract so for practical use let us study the application to the
pure super Yang–Mills case (2.2.21). We follow the discussion in [HKKP14]. Looking at the denominator of (2.2.21),
the poles come from the hyperplanes
HI,α={ϕI−aα= 0},eHI,α={aα−ϕI−ϵ12= 0}, H IJ,a=1,2={ϕI−ϕJ−ϵa= 0}. (2.3.15)
The corresponding charge vectors are {±eI}and{eI−eJ}, respectively and thus {QI}are chosen from them. Not
all of the poles are chosen but the JK residue procedure restricts which poles to evaluate. Again, we first choose
η= (1,1, . . . , 1) =Pk
i=1ei. The poles picked up are determined by the possible kcharges {Q1, . . . ,Qk}such that
the reference vector obeys the condition (2.3.6), which is
η=kX
I=1eI=kX
I=1λIQI, λ I>0. (2.3.16)
Two-instanton case Before moving on to higher instantons cases, let us see what will happen for the k= 2 case.
The poles come from {±e1,2}and{e1−e2,e2−e1}. The possible choices obeying η∈Cone( Q1,Q2)are illustrated
as
η
e1e2 η
e1−e1+e2 η
e1−e2e2
(2.3.17)
which give
{e1,e2},{e1,−e1+e2},{e2,e1−e2}. (2.3.18)
General case Using the condition η∈Cone( Q1, . . . ,Qk), we can further restrict the choice of the poles.
Lemma 2.3.1. The charge vectors {QI}do not contain elements of {−eI}.
Proof. Due to the Weyl invariance of the {eI}, it is enough to show that we can not have Q1=−e1. Assume that we
have this element and we have
η=kX
I=1eI=kX
I=1λkQI=−λ1e1+kX
I=2λIQI, λ i>0. (2.3.19)
For this condition to be obeyed, {QI}k
I=2needs to contain a vector taking the form as +e1. From the linear indepen-
dence, and the Weyl invariance, we can set Q2=e1−e2, which gives
kX
I=1eI= (λ2−λ1)e1−λ2e2+kX
I=3λIQI. (2.3.20)

# ページ 22

CHAPTER 2. ADHM THEORY AND SUPERSYMMETRIC LOCALIZATION 22
Similarly {QI}k
I=3needs to contain a vector taking the form as +e2. Doing this recursively, we can set
(Q1,Q2, . . . ,Qk−1,Qk) = (−e1,e1−e2, . . .ek−2−ek−1,ek−1−ek) (2.3.21)
which gives
kX
I=1eI=k−1X
I=1(λI+1−λI)eI−λkek. (2.3.22)
The first k−1terms can be tuned properly but the last term contradicts due to λk>0. Therefore, we can not have
{−eI}as the charge vectors.
Since{eI−eJ}generates only the Rk−1subspace, there should be one or more charges coming from {eI}. Using
the Weyl symmetry, let us choose e1, . . . ,epto be the charges chose from {eI}. The other k−pelements will be
divided into pgroups such that only one of eI(1≤I≤p)is included. For example, assume that we first choose e1.
Elements such as e1−eJare not included because if it is included, the condition (2.3.16) is translated to
kX
I=1eI= (λ1+λ2)e1−λ2e2+kX
I=3λIQI (2.3.23)
where we set J= 2 for simplicity. From the linear independence, Q3≤Ican not include {e1,e2}and after setting
λ1+λ2= 1, the above equation reduces to the computation in (2.3.19) and thus e1−eJis forbidden. Charges such
aseJ−e1will be only allowed and due to the linear independence, the charge eJ−e1needs to obey J /∈ {2, . . . , p }.
Starting from the two elements e1,eJ−e1, if the remaining elements contain eJ, then such an element must be
eK−eJforK /∈ {1, . . . , p } ∪ {J}. This is because eJbreaks the linear independence and eJ−eKwill not satisfy
the condition (2.3.16) as explained before. Doing this procedure recursively, the charge vectors obey a tree structure.
Lemma 2.3.2. The charge vectors {QI}form an oriented tree structure.
• The vertices are labeled with {eI}k
I=1and there are arrows connecting the vertices.
• The root vertex labeled with eJcorrespond with the charge vector +eJ.
• The tree grows by adding vertices eKtoeJwith an arrow J→Kand this correspond with the charge vector
eK−eJ. We call these arrows branches.
• There are only one vertex for each {eI}k
I=1.
For example, for k= 3, we have
e1 e2 e3
{e1,e2,e3}
e1
e2e3
{e1,e2−e1,e3}
e1
e2 e3
{e1,e2−e1,e3−e1}
e1 e2 e3
{e1,e2−e1,e3−e2}
(2.3.24)
and other possible cases are obtained by the Weyl reflection.
Classification of poles and Young diagrams The above tree structure determines the poles of the contour integral
(2.2.21). However, not all of the poles are non-zero and some of them still give zero residues. The poles that will
give non-zero residues have a nice combinatorial expression and they are actually labeled by colored Young diagrams
[Nak99, Nek02, NO03]. For the U(n)pure super Yang–Mills case, they are n-tuples of Young diagrams.
Let us briefly summarize the notations we use in this thesis. A Young diagram (two-dimensional partition) is a
sequence of non-negative integers obeying
λ= (λ1, λ2, . . . , λ i, . . .), λ i≥λi+1≥0,|λ|=λ1+···+λℓ(λ), (2.3.25)
where |λ|is the size, and ℓ(λ)is the length of the partition. The set of all possible 2d partitions/Young diagrams is
denoted as Pand the transpose is denoted as λTin the usual sense. A box positioned in the i′th row counted from the

23 CHAPTER 2. ADHM THEORY AND SUPERSYMMETRIC LOCALIZATION
bottom and j′th column counted from the left in the Young diagram is assigned a coordinate (i, j),1≤i≤ℓ(λ),1≤
j≤λi. For a box = (i, j)∈λ, we assign the coordinate as4
ϵ2
ϵ11··· i
a1...jc12() =c12(a,(i, j)) =a+ (i−1)ϵ1+ (j−1)ϵ2
(2.3.26)
The arm and leg length are defined as
aλ() =λi−j, ℓ λ() =λT
j−i, = (i, j). (2.3.27)
For later use, we also define the multiplicative coordinates ( q-coordinates) as
χ12,v() =ec12()=vqi−1
1qj−1
2, v =ea, q 1,2=eϵ1,2. (2.3.28)
Theorem 2.3.3. The poles of (2.2.21) are classified by n-tuples of Young diagrams ⃗λ={λ(α)}n
α=1:
{ϕI}k
I=1→ {aα+ (i−1)ϵ1+ (j−1)ϵ2|(i, j)∈λ(α)}n
α=1 (2.3.29)
where kcorresponds to the total number of boxes in the Young diagrams k=Pn
α=1|λ(α)|. Namely, each pole
corresponds to the coordinate of the box in the Young diagram.
Proof. We show this by induction. For k= 1, the pole come from ϕ1−aα= 0 for some αwhich corresponds to a
configuration where there is only one nonempty Young diagram with one box and others are empty.
Assume that for rank k−1, the Young diagram rule is true and the kindependent hyperplane equations are
{Q1, . . . ,Qk}. When the trees have no branches, the poles will be {ϕI−aα= 0}, which is the situation when the
nonempty Young diagrams contain only one box. Let us consider the case when Qk=eI−eJfor some I, J is a
branch at the end of a tree. This condition determines the pole for ϕI. Using the Weyl invariance, we can assume
that{ϕ1, . . . , ϕ k−1}are determined by {Q1, . . . ,Qk−1}and their corresponding hyperplanes, and ϕkis the last pole
determined by Qk=ek−eJfor some Jand its corresponding hyperplane Hk. By the induction hypothesis, the
poles{ϕ1, . . . , ϕ k−1}are classified by Young diagrams with k−1boxes denoted as ⃗λ. We thus need to show that the
possible choices of Qkhave a one to one correspondence with the possible way to add boxes to ⃗λgiving ⃗λ′=⃗λ+.
We can assume that ekbelongs to a tree whose root vertex corresponds to the pole at a∗. We denote the corre-
sponding Young diagrams as λ∗, λ′
∗=λ∗+. The factors related when evaluating ϕkare

Other factors in (2.2.21) will be regular in ϕk. The pole ϕkis then determined by ϕk−ϕJ=ϵ1,2. Due to the symmetry
between ϵ1↔ϵ2we can focus on the pole coming from ϕk−ϕJ=ϵ1. We denote ϕJ=a∗+ (x−1)ϵ1+ (y−1)ϵ2
andϕk=a∗+xϵ1+ (y−1)ϵ2. Under this situation, we have the following properties.
4We call both (i, j)andc12()coordinates.

CHAPTER 2. ADHM THEORY AND SUPERSYMMETRIC LOCALIZATION 24
•ϕJneeds to be in the boundary which means that ϕkcan not be included in the Young diagram. If (x+1, y)∈λ∗,
the zero coming fromQ
I̸=Jsh(ϕI−ϕJ)cancels the pole
sh(ϕk−c12(a∗, x+ 1, y)) sh( c12(a∗, x+ 1, y)−ϕk)
sh(ϕk−c12(a∗, x, y)−ϵ1)→0. (2.3.31)
• When (x, y)∈λ∗belongs to the boundary and x >1, y= 1, no pole cancellation occurs and we have a simple
pole. Namely, we can always add a box to this configuration without breaking the Young diagram condition.
• When (x, y)belongs to the boundary and x >1, y > 1, the induction hypothesis says that λ∗obeys the Young
diagram condition, i.e. (x, y−1)∈λ∗. We then have two possibilities depending on the position of (x+ 1, y).
–If(x+ 1, y−1)/∈λ∗, i.e.λ′
∗does not obey the Young diagram condition, then the simple pole vanishes
and the JK residue is zero.
–If(x+ 1, y−1)∈λ∗, i.e.λ′
∗obeys the Young diagram condition, then there is a simple pole and the JK
residue is nonzero.
This comes from
sh(c12(a∗, x, y−1)−ϕk+ϵ12)
sh(ϕk−c12(a∗, x, y)−ϵ1)×

1

sh(ϕk−c12(a∗, x+ 1, y−1)−ϵ2)


1,(x+ 1, y−1)/∈λ∗
1
sh(ϕk−c12(a∗, x, y)−ϵ1),(x+ 1, y−1)∈λ∗(2.3.32)
This concludes the inductive proof and the non-zero JK residues are indeed classified by n-tuples of Young diagrams.
The above discussion of the classification of the poles already gives the iterative process to take the JK-residue,
which was given in an abstract way in (2.3.13). Focusing on the n= 1 case, the poles are classified by the boxes
included in a Young diagram. Given a Young diagram λwithk-boxes, the non-zero JK-residue is computed by taking
the iterated integral in the order of the stacking of the boxes. Let {ϕ1∗, ϕ2∗,···ϕk∗}be the sequence of the coordinates
of the k-boxes in the Young diagram. For each step, the collection of boxes {ϕ1∗,···, ϕi∗}is a Young diagram with
i-boxes obeying the condition (2.3.25). Using the Weyl invariance, we can say that the contour integralH
dϕIpicks up
the pole at ϕI∗. Then, the multi-contour integral is evaluated in the orderH
ϕk=ϕk∗dϕk···H
ϕ1=ϕ1∗dϕ1. The resulting
residue actually does not depend on the ordering of {ϕ1∗,···ϕk∗}as long as the ordering is compatible with the
condition that for each step the Young diagram condition is obeyed. Thus, it is useful to fix the ordering in the boxes
of the Young diagram and take the iterative residue in such ordering. We define an ordering of the boxes in the Young
diagram as
ϵ2
ϵ1123456(i, j)<(i′, j′)⇔(j < j′)∨(j=j′, i < i′). (2.3.33)
This ordering induces an ordering in the coordinates c12(), χ12,v()
c12()< c12(), χ 12,v()< χ12,v() (2.3.34)
for <.

TheU(1) partition function is then written as
ZSYM=X
λq|λ|ZSYM[λ],ZSYM[λ] = Res
ϕ=ϕλµk(aα, ϕI, ϵ1,2)(2.3.35)
where we denoted the iterated residue as

andk=|λ|. The ordering in the sequence {ϕ∗

I=1is given by the ordering above.
For higher rank cases, we first decompose the k-variables {ϕI}k
I=1intongroups {ϕα,1, . . . ϕ α,kα}n
α=1withP
αkα=k. For each kαvariables {ϕα,I}kα
I=1, we assign the Young diagram (aα, λ(α))and the coordinates of
the boxes {ϕ∗
α,I}. The iterated residue can then be taken as

2.4 Characters and index
To get the instanton partition function, we need to evaluate the iterative residue (2.3.36) explicitly. Moreover, for
practical use, it is convenient to find a compact way to write down the partition function for each Young diagram λ.
In section 2.4.1, we discuss basic residue formulas and the relation with characters . We then rewrite the partition
function of pure SYM in terms of characters at section 2.4.2.
2.4.1 Residue formulas
Index functor For a character defined as
X=X
iniexi,(2.4.1)
where ni∈Z, the index functor to convert the additive components to multiplicative components is defined as5
I[X] =Y
iJxiKni, JxK=

x, (4d)
1−e−x, (5d)
θ(e−x;p), (6d)(2.4.2)
where the theta function is θ(x;p) = (x;p)∞(px−1;p)∞(see Appendix C for details of the notation).
The hierarchical structure between rational, trigonometric, and elliptic functions appears here by taking the limit
as
θ(e−x;p)p→0− − − → 1−e−x=x+O(x2). (2.4.3)
Most of the computations in this paper will be done explicitly using the trigonometric notation, so when not
mentioned we are using the following convention:
I[x] = (1 −x−1) = exp
−∞X
n=11
nx−n!
(2.4.4)
but using the formula in (2.4.2) one can convert the results to rational and elliptic ones.
The dual of the character is defined as
X∨=X
inie−xi(2.4.5)
5In this thesis, we will use two notations of the trigonometric index. One is the index here JxK= 1−e−xand the other is the symmetric index
sh(x) =ex/2−e−x/2used in the JK-residue. For quantum algebraic use, we will use the former notation so that we do not need to deal with the
square root factors. At the level of partition function, the difference will only appear as topological terms and Chern–Simons terms.

and we have the reflection property
I[X∨] = (−1)rkXdetXI[X] (2.4.6)
where rk X=P
inianddetX=Q
ienixi.
For a character X, we also define an operation
X[p]=X
iniepxi(2.4.7)
which is called the p-th Adams operation.
Definition 2.4.1. LetAbe a Laurent polynomial
A=X
(n1,...,n p)A⃗ nxn1
1···xnp
p,(2.4.8)
where the sum (n1, . . . , n p)is taken over some subset in Zp. If there is no constant term A⃗ n= 0 forn1=n2=
···np= 0, then Aismovable . The constant term is called the unmovable part. We denote the movable part and
unmovable part as
[A](̸=0),[A](0), (2.4.9)
respectively. Note that this means
A= [A](̸=0)+ [A](0). (2.4.10)
Residue formulas In the following sections, we will need to take residues of rational functions. We summarize the
properties of the residue formulas.
Definition 2.4.2. Letf(x)be a rational function whose zeros and poles are {p+
i}and{p−
j}respectively:
f(x) =Q
j(x−p+
j)
Q
i(x−p−
i). (2.4.11)
The residue at p−

af(x) = lim

a(x−p−
a)f(x) =Q
j(p−
a−p+
j)
Q
i̸=a(p−a−p−
i). (2.4.12)
This is the usual definition of the residue of a rational function. In the equivariant index formalism, it is natural to
deal with functions ˜f(x)written in products (1−a/x)−1. In such cases, the residue is defined as Res
x=ax−1˜f(x).
Definition 2.4.3. Given a rational function ˜f(x)written as
˜f(x) =I[X∨x] =Q
j(1−p+

˜f(x) =Q

i̸=a(1−p−
i/p−a). (2.4.14)
Note that the right hand side can be written also as
I[X∨p−
a+ 1] =Q
j(1−p+
j/p−
a)
Q
i̸=a(1−p−
i/p−a)(2.4.15)
and thus we have
Res
x=p−
ax−1˜f(x) = lim
x→p−
aI[X∨x+ 1].(2.4.16)
We may also study the residue formula for the dual rational function ˜f∨(x), which is defined as
˜f∨(x) =I[Xx∨] =Q
j(1−x/p+
j)
Q
i(1−x/p−
i). (2.4.17)

Moreover the right hand side can be written also as
Res
x=p−
ax−1˜f∨(x) =−I[Xp−∨
a+ 1],(2.4.19)
where an extra sign appears.
The sign appearing above will be important in later sections and one needs to be careful with these signs otherwise
the partition function obtained from the index formalism will not give the correct partition function.
Generally, we will have the following relation between the residue formula and the index computations.
Proposition 2.4.5. Letg(x)be a rational function defined as

j(1−x/q+

The residue formula has the following relation
Res
x=yx−1g(x) =(
+I[X∨y+Yy−1+ 1], y∈ {p−
i}
−I[X∨y+Yy−1+ 1], y∈ {q−
i}. (2.4.22)
2.4.2 Pure SYM
For later use, we change the notations used in the previous section. Instead of using the sh(ϕ)notation, we use the
I[x]notation.
Proposition 2.4.6. The LMNS formula is rewritten as

Note that dϕI=x−1
IdxI. The notation here is the same with (2.2.21) up to redefinition of the topological terms
and inclusion of Chern–Simons terms.
Let us understand the rational functions inside the contour integral by using the characters. Define

Thm. 2.3.3 tells us that the poles are classified by n-tuples of Young diagrams as
{xI}I=1,...,k−→ { χ12,vα() =vαqi−1

Gauge Origami
In this chapter, we discuss a physical setup called gauge origami , originally introduced by Nekrasov [Nek15, Nek16,
Nek17a]. The gauge origami setup is a physical setup where generalizations of the instantons in Chap. 2 appear. Two
generalizations of instantons will be discussed. One is instantons of higher dimensional gauge theories, and the other
is instantons of intersecting gauge theories. String theoretically, we will show that they appear as the low energy
worldvolume theories of higher dimensional and generally intersecting D-branes. The goal of this chapter is to derive
the ADHM-like equations of these generalized instantons from the string theoretic viewpoint.
In particular, in section 3.1, we briefly summarize the ADHM data of the instantons we are interested in. We then
explain the physical setup of the gauge origami system in section 3.2. Similar to the pure SYM case, supersymmetries
will play important roles and they are reviewed in section 3.3. The NS B-field is inevitable to consider such systems
and it is also reviewed. At the end, we will see that two supersymmetries are preserved in all the setups. We then
briefly study the open string spectrum in section 3.4 and construct 2d N= (0,2)quiver gauge theories appearing at
the low energy limit. The vacuum moduli space at the end coincides with the ADHM equations.
3.1 Generalized instantons
In this section, we discuss generalizations of instantons in higher dimensional and intersecting gauge theories. We give
the information of the instanton moduli space in a top-down way. The physical interpretations of them are explained
in the following sections. See [ST22, Kan20] for reviews and references.
Higher dimensional instantons LetMdbe a connected oriented Riemannian manifold of even dimension 2d≥4
and⋆the corresponding Hodge dual. Generalized instantons are defined as localized finite-action solutions of the
gauge theory on Mnobeying
Σ∧F=⋆F (3.1.1)
where Ais the 1-form gauge connection, F=dA+A∧Ais the curvature, and Σis a differential form of degree
2d−4. By the famous Derrick’s Theorem [Der64], localized solutions with finite YM action is forbidden for n >2.
For a localized solution A=Aµdxµ, we can rescale the coordinates x→λxwithλ∈R>0. The action changes as
SYM(λ) =λ4−2dSYM. Since S′
YM(1)<0ford >2, we do not have a localized solution. In this sense, naively such
kind of instantons do not exist. We can cure the problem by considering noncommutative instantons because Derrick’s
Theorem does not hold for such nontrivial background. The instantons we are considering will be noncommutative
instantons.
Let us quote the ADHM type equations for instantons in higher dimensional theories. We introduce N=Cn,K=
Cksimilar to Chap. 2.

Instantons of intersecting gauge theories Let us discuss the generalization of instantons that arise from intersecting
gauge theories. There are two setups discussed in this thesis.
•Spiked instanton [NP16, Nek16, Nek15]: Roughly speaking, it is a setup of six copies of (2.2.6). We introduce
six vector spaces NA=CnA(A∈6)(see section 3.2 for the notations) and K=Ck. The ADHM variables
are
IA:NA→K,JA:K→NA,Ba:K→K. (3.1.8)

A=εA¯As¯Awhich implies sAis a real map giving six real conditions. Note also that
µA, sA, µR∈Hom ( K,K). The moment map equations are then given as

introduce four vector spaces N¯a=Cn¯a(a∈4)andK=Ck. The ADHM variables are Ba∈Hom ( K,K)
andI¯a∈Hom ( N¯a,K). We then introduce the following moment maps:

condition µA= 0.

3.2 Physical setup of gauge origami
In this section, we will consider string theoretic realizations of instantons. We will generalize the concept of instan-
tons in two directions. One is instantons of higher dimensional gauge theories and the other will be instantons of
generalized gauge theories . Both of these generalizations are naturally incorporated in the framework introduced by
Nekrasov, which is called gauge origami .
Roughly speaking, the gauge origami system is a gauge theory whose space-time Scontains several (generally)
intersecting components as
S=[
iSi.(3.2.1)
For each component Si, there is a gauge group Gi. Matter fields appear at the intersection Si∩ Sjand they transform
under the gauge group Gi×Gjand thus they are bifundamental multiplets. In this sense, we can also understand them
as generalized quiver gauge theories.
Let the ten-dimensional spacetime be R1,9=R1,1×R8and we write it as R1,1×C4by choosing a complex
structure on R8. Generally, we can consider the spacetime to be R1,1×Z, where Zis a toric Calabi–Yau four-fold but
we only focus on the case when Z=C4in this thesis. The coordinates are assigned as
C1 C2 C3 C4 R1,1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
x1x2x3x4x5x6x7x8x9x0
z1 z2 z3 z4 x, t(3.2.2)
where we denoted the real coordinates as {xi}9
i=0and the four complex coordinates as {za}4
a=1withza=x2a−1+
ix2a.
There are four complex one-planes and three-planes which we denote as Ca,C3
¯afora∈4,¯a∈4∨, where
4={1,2,3,4},4∨={123,124,134,234}. (3.2.3)
In later sections, we will frequently use the symmetry between the four variables 1↔2↔3↔4. We call this
symmetry the quadrality6.
The complement ¯AofA∈6is defined for example as A= 12,¯A= 34 . Note that we have 4≃4∨under the
mapa∈4↔¯a∈4∨. We introduce the set 3as the quotient 6/∼where A∼¯Ais
(12)∼(34),(13)∼(24),(23)∼(14) (3.2.4)
and choose the representative as A=a4, a∈[3]. We also use
A= (ab),sup(A) =b,inf(A) =a (3.2.5)

two-planes are denoted as C2
AforA∈6, where 6={12,13,14,23,24,34}corresponds to the set of the two element
subsets of 4. All of this data can be summarized in a tetrahedron (see Figure 3.1).
The gauge origami system appears as the low energy limit of the world volume theory on multiple intersecting
D-branes in type II string theory. Depending on which type of complex planes the D-branes wrap, different gauge
origami systems appear. Generally, one may consider arbitrary D-branes to appear in the setup. However, generally
the number of supersymmetries will not be enough and it will be difficult to compute physical observables explicitly.
Thus, we want a nice setup that preserves suitable amount of supersymmetries. The way how to count supersymmetries
will be explicitly discussed in section 3.3.
The gauge origami system we will focus on this thesis is a setup where D-branes wrap the complex planes
C2,C3,C4. Moreover, in particular, we are interested in instantons appearing in the theory. The instantons will
appear as point like objects in the C4. Let us briefly summarize the setups that will be mainly discussed in this thesis.
• Spiked instanton [Nek15, Nek16, Nek17a, NP16]: This is a setup where the D5-branes wrap C2
A×R1,1(A∈6)
while the D1-branes wrap R1,1. The brane configuration is written as

D524• • − − • • − − − −
D534• • • • − − − − − −(3.2.6)
where −means the brane extends in the corresponding direction and •means it is point-like. We may also take
the T-duality in the R1,1part and get intersecting D4-branes and D3-branes in type IIA and IIB string theory,
respectively. The D1-branes will be D0 and D (−1)-branes respectively under this transformation.
Depending on which D5-branes exist in the theory, we usually call them with different names (see Figure 3.2).
For the case when we only have a stack of D5 A(A∈6) branes, the D1-branes are the ordinary instantons. For
the setup with D5-branes transverse with each other such as D5 12and D5 34, we usually call them the crossed

instantons . For D5-brane configurations sharing a common C-plane such as D5 12and D5 23, we call them the
folded instantons .
• Tetrahedron instanton [PYZ21, PYZ23, FM23]: This is a setup where the D7-branes wrap C3
¯a×R1,1fora∈4.
The brane configuration is summarized as

and generally we have four stacks of D7-branes wrapping different complex three-planes in C4. Again, we can
take T-duality in the R1,1direction and obtain D0–D6 and D (−1)–D5 setups.
• Magnificent four [Nek17d, NP18, NP23]: The D9-branes wrap the entire C4

Similarly, T-duality gives the D0–D8 and D (−1)–D7 setups.
3.3 Intersecting D-branes and supersymmetries
Naively, the setups (3.2.6), (3.2.7), (3.2.8) seem to not preserve supersymmetry. However, it seems that after in-
troducing a suitable constant Neveu–Schwarz B-field to the system, all of the systems will preserve at least two
supersymmetries. Moreover, under such situation, supersymmmetric localization will be applicable (see Chap. 4). In
this section, let us derive the number of preserved supersymmetries for each gauge origami setup. We focus on the type
IIB string theory description with all the D-branes wrapping the two-dimensional R1,1space. Dimensional reduction
by taking the T-duality can be done similarly and the result will be the same.
Let us summarize the notations of the spinor representations we use in this section. For details, see Appendix A.
The Dirac matrix obeys
{Γµ,Γν}= 2ηµν, µ, ν = 0,1, . . . , 9 (3.3.1)

forηµν= diag( −1,+1, . . . , +1). We choose the matrix expression
Γ1=σ1⊗1⊗1⊗1⊗1, Γ2=σ2⊗1⊗1⊗1⊗1
Γ3=σ3⊗σ1⊗1⊗1⊗1, Γ4=σ3⊗σ2⊗1⊗1⊗1,
Γ5=σ3⊗σ3⊗σ1⊗1⊗1, Γ6=σ3⊗σ3⊗σ2⊗1⊗1,
Γ7=σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ1⊗1,Γ8=σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ2⊗1
Γ9=σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ1,Γ0=σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗(iσ2).(3.3.2)
Under this expression, the chirality matrix Γis defined as
Γ = Γ0Γ1···Γ9=σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3. (3.3.3)
Since the D-branes appearing in the gauge origami system wrap R1,1and the complex planes Ca(a∈4), it is
convenient to use the bases diagonalized by
(S0, S1, S2, S3, S4):= (Γ0Γ9,−iΓ1Γ2,−iΓ3Γ4,−iΓ5Γ6,−Γ7Γ8). (3.3.4)
The eigenstates are denoted as |⃗ s⟩=|s0, s1, s2, s3, s4⟩with
Sa|⃗ s⟩=sa|⃗ s⟩, s a∈ {± 1}. (3.3.5)
For later use, we also shortly write the product of Gamma matrices as ΓA=Q
a∈AΓafor a subset A⊆ {0,1, . . . , 9}.
We will also sometimes omit the factor 1and just write the signs when we discuss on the eigenvalues {sa}a=0,1,2,3,4.
In type IIB string theory, the supercharges originating from left and right-moving world sheet degrees of freedom
transform as spinors with the same chirality:P
αξL,αQα+P
βξR,βeQβ. We then have
ΓξL=ξL,ΓξR=ξR. (3.3.6)
The conditions for supersymmetries preserved in D-branes are summarized in Appendix A. Let us study the situation
when we only have a D-brane wrapping one of the complex planes in C4with a D1-brane bound to them.
D1–D5 system Consider the situation with D5 12and D1-branes. The supersymmetric condition is
D1(09) : Γ09ξR=ξL,
D512(091234) : Γ09Γ1234ξR=ξL(3.3.7)
where each condition gives 16supercharges. Imposing both conditions give Γ1234ξL=ξL. Since (Γ1234)2= 1, the
spinor belongs to the eigenspace with eigenvalue +1and the possible ξLis 8-dimensional. The other ξRis automatically
determined by the above condition. Therefore, this setup preserves 8 supercharges and it is supersymmetric.
D1–D7 system Consider the situation with D 7123and D1-branes. The supersymmetric condition is
D1(09) : Γ09ξR=ξL,
D7123(09123456) : Γ09Γ123456ξR=ξL(3.3.8)
giving Γ123456ξL=ξL. However, since (Γ123456)2=−1, we have no such kind of spinors and thus this setup is not
supersymmetric.
D1–D9 system The D 94-brane and D1-brane gives
D1(09) : Γ09ξR=ξL,
D94(0912345678) : Γ09Γ12345678ξR=ξL(3.3.9)
giving Γ12345678ξL=ξL. Similarly, we have (Γ12345678)2= +1 and we have a spinor obeying the above conditions
and thus it is supersymmetric.

CHAPTER 3. GAUGE ORIGAMI 36
Supersymmetry under NS B-fields The D1–D7 system above is not supersymmetric. Witten showed that after
turning on a suitable constant NS B-field, the D1–D7 system can gain supersymmetries [Wit00]. We turn on a
constant B-field along C4taking the form
B=X

and define
e2πiva=1 +iba
1−iba,−1
2< va<1
2. (3.3.11)
Turning on this B-field effectively rotates the D-brane by the angles 2πvaand the conditions on the spinors will be
modified. For example, a D-brane extending in the (2a−1,2a)-plane and rotated with the angle ωgives
ΓAΓ2a−1,2aexpω
2Γ2a−1,2a

a∈ARa(θ) = exp X
a∈AθaΓ2a−1Γ2a!
. (3.3.16)
Using this, let us revisit the D1–D7 system. The supersymmetric condition is now modified to
R123(θ)ξL=ξL. (3.3.17)
Using the bases |⃗ s⟩, this condition is
exp (is1θ1+is2θ2+is3θ3) = +1 (3.3.18)
givingP
a∈¯4saθa∈2πZ. Note also that since the chirality of ξLis positive, the other condition is
s0s1s2s3s4= +1 . (3.3.19)
When {θa}a∈4are generic we have four supersymmetries. Given a (s1, s2, s3)obeying (3.3.18), (−s1,−s2,−s3)
is also a solution. The other condition (3.3.19) determines the product s0s4uniquely and we have two choices of
(s0, s4). Therefore, generically, we will have four supersymmetries. When special conditions are imposed to the
B-field parameters {θa}a∈4, enhancement of supersymmetries may occur but we do not discuss such cases.
Explicitly, for example, we have the following solutions.
• When θ1+θ2+θ3= 2π, we have for example (s1, s2, s3) = (+ ,+,+),(−,−,−). Using (3.3.19), the other
signs are determined as
(s0, s1, s2, s3, s4) = (+ ,+,+,+,+),(−,+,+,+,−),(+,−,−,−,−),(−,−,−,−,+) (3.3.20)
which gives 4 supersymmetries.

• When θ1−θ2−θ3= 0, the solutions are
(s0, s1, s2, s3, s4) = (+ ,+,−,−,+),(−,+,−,−,−),(+,−,+,+,−),(−,−,+,+,+) (3.3.21)
which also gives 4 supersymmetries. Other cases such as −θ1+θ2−θ3= 0are obtained by using the triality.
In terms of {va}a∈4, the condition is written as ±v1±v2±v3=±1/2. Note that when the B-field is absent, i.e.
va= 0andθa=π/2, none of the above conditions is satisfied and it is compatible with the previous discussion that
the system is not supersymmetric.
3.3.1 Magnificent four
Let us consider the magnificent four system with constant B-field. The supersymmetric condition is modified to
D1(09) : Γ09ξR=ξL,
D94(0912345678) : Γ09R1234(θ)ξR=ξL(3.3.22)
which gives R1234(θ)ξL=ξL. Using the basis |⃗ s⟩, the condition is translated to
exp
iX
a∈4saθa
= +1 ,X
a∈4saθa∈2πZ. (3.3.23)
Since θa< π, we have the following cases:
X
a∈4saθa= 2π,0,−2π.(3.3.24)
For generic θa, if(s1, s2, s3, s4)obeys the condition (3.3.23), then (−s1,−s2,−s3,−s4)also obeys the condition
(3.3.23). For each cases, the remaining s0is automatically determined by (3.3.18) and thus we have two supersymme-
tries. Note that when there is no B-field with θa=π/2 (a∈4), there are solutions obeying the conditions and thus it
is supersymmetric as mentioned before.
3.3.2 Tetrahedron instanton
As mentioned before, the D1–D7 123system is supersymmetric with B-field. Let us place other D7-branes in the setup
as (3.2.7) and analyze the condition for unbroken supersymmetry following [PYZ21]. The conditions are
D1 : Γ09ξR=ξL,
D7¯a: Γ09R¯a(θ)ξR=ξL,∀a∈4.(3.3.25)
The conditions from D1–D7 gives
R¯a(θ)ξL=ξL, a∈4 (3.3.26)
and the conditions from D 7¯a–D7¯bfora̸=bgives
R¯a(θ)ξL=R¯a(θ)ξL. (3.3.27)
Using the bases |⃗ s⟩, we have
exp

α∈¯asαθα!

iX
α∈¯asαθα!
= exp
iX
β∈¯bsβθβ
(∀a̸=b∈4). (3.3.28)
Since any two stacks of D7-branes share a complex two-plane, the second condition is translated to
exp (isaθa−isbθb) = +1 ,∀a̸=b. (3.3.29)

# ページ 38

CHAPTER 3. GAUGE ORIGAMI 38
This condition gives θa=θbbecause θa∈(0, π)andsaθa−sbθb= 0. Moreover, we need sa, sbto be the same
signs. Thus, the possible solution is only
θ1=θ2=θ3=θ4=2π
3(3.3.30)
and
s1=s2=s3=s4=±1, s 0= 1 (3.3.31)
where s0is automatically determined by (3.3.19). Therefore, we have two supersymmetries in this setup.
3.3.3 Spiked instanton
Let us discuss the spiked instanton setup. Since the D1-D5 setup preserves supersymmetry in the absence of B-field,
let us first consider if we can have a supersymmetric system without the B-field. The analysis of this setup was done
in [NP16] and this part is based on it.
Including the six stacks of D5-branes give the following conditions
D1 : Γ09ξR=ξL,
D5A(A∈6) : Γ09Y
a∈AΓ2a−1Γ2aξR=ξL.(3.3.32)
Explicitly, we have
Γ1234ξL=ξL,Γ1256ξL=ξL,Γ1278ξL=ξL,Γ3456ξL=ξL,Γ3478ξL=ξL,Γ5678ξL=ξL. (3.3.33)
All of these conditions can not be satisfied because for example the first and second conditions give Γ3456ξL=−ξL,
which breaks the fourth condition.
Four D5-branes and two anti D5-branes One way to resolve this situation is to include anti D5-branes to the setup
us

This system was introduced and studied in [NP16]. Since the supersymmetry condition for the anti D-branes reverse
the signs as Γ01···pξR=−ξL, the conditions are written as
Γ1234ξL=ξL,Γ1256ξL=−ξL,Γ1278ξL=ξL,Γ3456ξL=ξL,Γ3478ξL=−ξL,Γ5678ξL=ξL.(3.3.35)
This can be also written as Y
a∈AΓ2a−1,2aξL=εA¯AξL (3.3.36)
where ε1234= +1 is the anti-symmetric tensor and for example ε(12)(34) = +1 . The first and second conditions now
giveΓ3456ξL=ξLbecause of the extra sign coming from the anti-brane contribution. Similarly,the fifth and sixth
condition comes from the first and third, the second and third conditions, respectively and thus we only have three
independent conditions.
Taking the first three conditions to be the three independent conditions, using the operators (3.3.4), the conditions
are
S1S2ξL=−ξL, S 1S3ξL= +ξL, S 1S4ξL=−ξL, (3.3.37)

# ページ 39

39 CHAPTER 3. GAUGE ORIGAMI
where note that the extra ifactor gives a flip of the sign. Using the bases ξL=|⃗ s⟩, the conditions are
s1s2=−1, s 1s3= +1 , s 1s4=−1, (3.3.38)
which gives
(s1, s2, s3, s4) = (+ ,−,+,−),(−,+,−,+). (3.3.39)
Moreover, using (3.3.19), s0is uniquely determined and we have
(s0, s1, s2, s3, s4) = (+ ,+,−,+,−),(+,−,+,−,+). (3.3.40)
In conclusion, this setup preserves two supersymmetries.
4 SUSY system As an exercise, let us also discuss on branes systems with 4 supersymmetries. Depending on the
brane systems, the preserved 4 supersymmetries will change but in any cases, we have a common two supersymmetry
taking the form (s0, s1, s2, s3, s4) = (+ ,+,−,+,−),(+,−,+,−,+).
• D5-branes wrapping complex two-planes inside C3
123: Namely, we have D 512,D513,D523-branes and the con-
ditions are
Γ1234ξL=ξL,Γ1256ξL=−ξL,Γ3456ξL=ξL, (3.3.41)
and using (3.3.4) gives
S1S2ξL=−ξL, S 1S3ξL= +ξL, S 2S3, ξL=−ξL. (3.3.42)
Since the third condition is automatically satisfied when the first and second conditions are satisfied, we have
s1s2=−1, s1s3= +1 giving (s1, s2, s3) = (+ ,−,+),(−,+,−). The condition (3.3.19) only determines
the product s0s4and we have two possibilities for each case:
(s0, s1, s2, s3, s4) = (+ ,+,−,+,−),(−,+,−,+,+),(+,−,+,−,+),(−,−,+,−,−). (3.3.43)
Therefore, this system preserves four supersymmetries in total. From the 2d theory on R1,1viewpoint, this gives
a 2dN= (2,2)theory, which can be obtained from the dimensional reduction of a 4d N= 1theory.
• Transverse D5-branes: A different situation when we have four supersymmetries is when we have two stacks of
D-branes wrapping the complex two-planes C2
12,C2
34:
Γ1234ξL=ξL,Γ5678ξL=ξL, (3.3.44)
which is equivalent to
S1S2ξL=−ξL, S 3S4ξL=−ξL. (3.3.45)
These give s1s2=−1ands3s4=−1which automatically give s0= +1 . The possible choices are then
(s0, s1, s2, s3, s4) = (+ ,+,−,+,−),(+,+,−,−,+),(+,−,+,+,−),(+,−,+,−,+), (3.3.46)
which gives four supersymmetries. From the viewpoint of the 2d theory, all of them have positive chiralities and
then it is a 2d (0,4)supersymmetric field theory.
• Transverse anti D5-branes: The other situation when we have anti D5-branes wrapping transverse complex
two-planes C2
13andC2
24give
Γ1256ξL=−ξL,Γ3478ξL=−ξL (3.3.47)
which is
S1S3ξL=ξL, S 2S4ξL=ξL (3.3.48)
ands1s3= +1 , s2s4= +1 . Therefore, we have four supersymmetries
(s0, s1, s2, s3, s4) = (+ ,+,+,+,+),(+,−,+,−,+),(+,+,−,+,−),(+,−,−,−,−). (3.3.49)
Again, from the 2d theory viewpoint, this theory also gives a 2d N= (0,4)theory.

CHAPTER 3. GAUGE ORIGAMI 40
Inclusion of B-field Following the magnificent four and tetrahedron instanton system, let us include a constant B-
field and see what will happen. We first consider the case when we have only one D 512-brane. The condition will
be
D1(09) : Γ09ξR=ξL,
D512(091234) : Γ09R12(θ)ξR=ξL(3.3.50)
which gives R12(θ)ξL=ξL:
exp (is1θ1+is2θ2) = +1 . (3.3.51)
Since θ1,2∈(0, π), the possible solution is only s1θ1+s2θ2= 0, which gives (s1, s2) = (+ ,−),(−,+)andθ1=θ2.
In terms of {va}, this is v1−v2= 0.
Note that if we use the anti D5-brane, the condition is R12(θ)ξL=−ξL:
exp (is1θ1+is2θ2) =−1 (3.3.52)
whose solution is s1θ1+s2θ2=±π. The solution of this is θ1+θ2=πwith(s1, s2) = (+ ,+),(−,−). Moreover,
in terms of {va}, this condition is v1+v2= 0, which translates to b1+b2= 0. This means that the B-field is
anti-self-dual.
Let us consider next the situation when we have the six D5-branes with no anti-branes. The supersymmetric
condition is modified as
D1 : Γ09ξR=ξL,
D5A: Γ09RA(θ)ξR=ξL,∀A∈6.(3.3.53)
The D1–D5 Agives RA(θ)ξL=ξLand the D 5A–D5B(A̸=B) gives RA(θ)ξL=RB(θ)ξL. Using the bases |⃗ s⟩, the
solution is
exp (isaθa+isbθb) = +1 ,∀(ab)∈6. (3.3.54)
This has no solution unless θa= 0, πfor all a∈4and thus turning on a finite B-field does not make the brane
configuration supersymmetric.
Let us then include the anti D5-branes to the setup. The condition is then rewritten as
RA(θ)ξL=εA¯AξL. (3.3.55)
This gives
exp (isaθa+isbθb) =εabab,(ab)∈6. (3.3.56)
Explicitly, we have
exp(is1θ1+is2θ2) = +1 ,exp(is1θ1+is3θ4) =−1,
exp(is1θ1+is4θ4) = +1 ,exp(is2θ2+is3θ3) = +1 ,
exp(is2θ2+is4θ4) =−1,exp(is3θ3+is4θ4) = +1 ,(3.3.57)
which gives
s1θ1+s2θ2= 0, s 1θ1+s3θ3=±π,
s1θ1+s4θ4= 0, s 2θ2+s3θ3= 0,
s2θ2+s4θ4=±π, s 3θ3+s4θ4= 0.(3.3.58)
The only solution is θa=π/2which reduce to the situation with no B-field. At the end we have two supersymmetries.
Remark 3.3.1 .Actually there is a different setup that preserves supersymmetry which somehow we lack discussions
in the context of gauge origami. It is a setup when we have six stacks of anti D5-branes:
Γ09Y
a∈AΓ2a−1Γ2aξR=−ξL.(3.3.59)
Including the D1-branes gives
Γ1234ξL=−ξL,Γ1256ξL=−ξL,Γ1278ξL=−ξL,Γ3456ξL=−ξL,Γ3478ξL=−ξL,Γ5678ξL=−ξL.
(3.3.60)

41 CHAPTER 3. GAUGE ORIGAMI
These conditions are compatible because for example the first and second conditions give
Γ1234Γ1256ξL=−Γ1234ξL=ξL,
−Γ3456ξL=ξL(3.3.61)
which is compatible with the fourth condition.
Including the B-field gives
RA(θ)ξL=−ξL, A∈6 (3.3.62)
which is translated to
exp (isaθa+isbθb) =−1,(ab)∈6. (3.3.63)
Using the condition θa∈(0, π), we have saθa+sbθb=±π. The solution is then
θ1=θ2=θ3=θ4=π/2,(s0, s1, s2, s3, s4) = (+ ,+,+,+,+),(+,−,−,−,−) (3.3.64)
and we have two supersymmetries. Note that v1=v2=v3=v4= 0and this is the situation with no B-field.
3.4 Open string spectrum
In this section, we review the open string spectrum with a nontrivial B-field (3.3.10) and derive the matter fields arising
in the gauge origami system. For reference, see [ACNY87] or [NP16, App. A].
The worldsheet action of the open string on the background R1,1×C4in (3.2.2) is given as

where Gµν=ηµν,Bµνis (3.3.10), and σ±=τ±σ,∂±= (∂τ±∂σ)/2are the light-cone coordinates. See
Appendix B for the analysis when there is no B-field. The equations of motion are
∂+∂−Xµ= 0, ∂ +ψµ

σ=0= 0.(3.4.3)
Similar to the case when there is no B-field, we have two types of boundary conditions. One is the Dirichlet (D)
boundary condition
δXµ|σ=0,π= 0 ⇔∂τXµ|σ=0,π= 0 (3.4.4)
and the other is the twisted (T) boundary condition
(Gµν∂σXµ+Bµν∂τXµ)|σ=0,π= 0. (3.4.5)
The twisted boundary condition is just the Neumann boundary condition when the B-field is absent.
In our setup, we have D1-branes wrapping R1,1, D5A(A∈6)branes wrapping R1,1×C2
A, D7 ¯a(¯a∈4∨)branes
wrapping R1,1×C3
¯a, and D9-branes wrapping R1,1×C4
4(see section 3.2 for the notation). Thus, for the R1,1-part,
the open strings will always obey the NN boundary condition
∂σX0,9|σ=0=∂σX0,9|σ=π= 0. (3.4.6)
For the remaining eight directions in C4, it is convenient to combine the real coordinates and introduce the complex
coordinates
Za=X2a−1+iX2a,¯Za=X2a−1−iX2a, a∈4. (3.4.7)

# ページ 42

CHAPTER 3. GAUGE ORIGAMI 42
Under these complex coordinates, the twisted boundary condition where the B-field appears can be written as
(∂+−e−2πiνa∂−)Za|σ=0= (∂+−e−2πiν′
a∂−)Za|σ=π= 0, (3.4.8)
where νa, ν′
adetermines the boundary condition of the end of string σ= 0, π, respectively. Let us focus on σ= 0for
the moment. If the string ends on a D-brane wrapping Ca, then νa=va, otherwise it is ν= 1/2. We have the same
relation for the ν′
a.
The mode expansion that obeys the EOM and the boundary conditions is
νa=ν′

Taking the light cone gauge (see Appendix B.3 for an example), the mass for the two-dimensional particle of R1,1
is proportional to
m2∝(bN+eE0) (3.4.17)
wherebNcounts the mode fluctuations from the C4part and eE0is the total zero-point energy.
3.4.1 Magnificent four
Let us study the open string spectrum of the magnificent four setup where we have kD1-branes wrapping R1,1andn
D9-branes wrapping R1,1×C4. Again, we turn on the B-field along the D9-branes as in (3.3.10).
D1–D1 strings Let us first study the the D1–D1 strings. It is well-known that the low energy field theory of k
parallel D1-branes is obtained by the dimensional reduction of 10d N= 1 U( k)SYM, which is the 2d N= (8,8)
U(k)SYM. Let us review the derivation of this. The open strings obey the NN boundary conditions along R1,1and
DD boundary conditions along C4. The zero point energy of the NS sector is computed as eE0=−1/2.
In the R sector, the zero-point energy vanishes, and the level zero bN= 0 states give the massless states. The ten
zero-modes coming from the fermions give the 32 degenerate ground states |⃗ s⟩R. After GSO projection, half of them
remain giving 16 fermions.
In the NS sector, the ground state |0⟩NSgives the eE0=−1/2which is tachyonic. GSO projection removes this
state and the level one excitation coming from ψµ
−1/2|0⟩NS(µ= 1, . . . , 8)in light-cone gauge give the massless
spectrum. From the 2d theory viewpoint, the eight real scalars correspond to the bosonic coordinates x1, . . . , x8. We
can combine them into four complex scalars Ba(a∈4)and their complex conjugates.
D1–D9 strings The T-dualized setup of ours was analyzed in [Wit00]. We follow the discussion there. In this case,
the boundary conditions for the D1–D9 strings are NN along R1,1and DT along C4. We then have δ= 1/2−va.
Using (3.4.16), the zero-point energy of the NS sector is computed as
eE0=X
a∈4eE1
2−va
=1
2
1−X
a∈4|va|
 (3.4.18)
where we used −1/2< va<1/2. WhenP
a∈4|va|= 1, the ground state coming from bN= 0is massless and unique
since there are no worldsheet zero modes to be quantized. It will give a massless boson, which will be denoted I(see
section 3.5.2). For the R sector, since the zero-point energy is zero, there is a unique fermionic ground state coming
frombN= 0. Combining both of them give a 2d N= (0,2)chiral multiplet (see section 3.5 for the notations).
Let us consider the case when the B-field is absent. For this case, we can formally set va= 0 ( a∈4)and the
zero-point energy is eE0= 1/2. Since physical states need to obey bN+ 1/2 = 0 , there are no physical states in the
NS sector. For the R-sector, the ground state survives. We thus obtain a Fermi multiplet in this case.
Note that when the B-field is absent orP
a∈4|va|<1, since the zero-point energy is positive, we do not have any
massless bosons. For the computations in later sections to be applicable, we need the nontrivial B-field. On the other
hand whenP
a∈4|va|>1, the theory is unstable and expected to decay to a supersymmetric ground state with two
supersymmetries.

3.4.2 Tetrahedron instanton
Let us consider the tetrahedron instanton setup where we have kD1-branes and n¯aD7¯a-branes. We focus on the
spectrum coming from the D1–D7 strings. Using the quadrality, we can focus on the D7 123-branes. The boundary
conditions are NN in R1,1, DD in C4and DT in C3
123.
In the R sector, the zero-point energy vanishes. In the light-cone gauge, we have two-zero modes coming from the
C4part give the fermionic massless states with spin ±1/2under rotations in C4. GSO projection kills one of them.
In the NS sector, the zero-point energy is computed as

WhenP
a=1,2,3|va|= 1/2, the ground state energy vanishes. Since there are no worldsheet zero-modes, there is a
unique massless ground state with vanishing spin. It survives the GSO projection and gives a real scalar field which
will be denoted as I¯4(see section 3.5.3). Combining with the D7–D1 strings and the fermions coming from the
Ramond sectors, we obtain a N= (2,2)chiral multiplet.
3.4.3 Spiked instanton
Let us discuss the massless spectrum for the spiked instanton setup where we have D5-branes wrapping R1,1×C2
A
(A∈6). For a detailed analysis see [NP16]. We focus on the D1–D5 Astrings. The boundary conditions are NN for
R1,1, DD for C2
¯Aand DT for C2
A. We have δ=va−1/2for bosons Za(a∈A)andδ= 0 fora∈¯AgivingZ+δ
modings. The R fermions similarly have the same modings with the bosons while the NS fermions have Z+vafor
a∈AandZ+ 1/2fora∈¯A.
The zero-point energy for the NS sector is given as
eE0=X
i∈A=(ab)eE1
2−va
+ 2eE(0) =−1
2(|va|+|vb|). (3.4.20)
To study the low energy spectrum, we need to study the action of fermionic operators with modes Z+vaand deal
with the parameters vacarefully. Since it is tedious to do so, in this thesis we simply set va=vb= 0 and consider
the massless spectrum. The massless spectrum arising from this is the dimensional reduction of the 4d N= 2
hypermultiplet giving the 2d N= (4,4)bifundamental hypermultiplet.
3.5 2d N= (0,2)quiver gauge theories and vacuum moduli space
Given the open string spectrum, we now know that the low energy effective theory of the D1-branes is given by a 2d
N= (0,2)theory. However, the matter contents given in the previous section are not enough to determine this theory
and we need to consider interaction terms coming from the so-called JandE-terms. To get such terms from string
theory, one needs to study correlation functions of open string vertex operators. See [BFF+21] for the magnificent
four setup and [NP16] for the spiked instanton setup. Instead of proceeding in this direction, we will rather use the
symmetries such as the quadrality in the gauge origami setup and derive the corresponding JandE-terms.
We first review some general aspects of 2d N= (0,2)quiver gauge theories, and then discuss how to determine
theJandE-terms of the gauge origami system. Given such JandE-terms, we will show that the vacuum moduli
space coincides with the instanton moduli space discussed in section 3.1.
3.5.1 General structure
Let us briefly review basic aspects of the two-dimensional N= (0,2)gauge theory using the superfield formalism.
TheN= (0,2)superspace is parametrized by the space-time coordinates x0, x1and fermionic coordinates θ+,¯θ+.
TheN= (0,2)supersymmetry is generated by two chiral supercharges Q+,Q+:
Q2
+=Q2
+= 0,{Q+,Q+}=−i(∂0+∂1). (3.5.1)

The operators have a differential operator representation
Q+=∂
∂θ++i
2θ+(∂0+∂1),Q+=−∂
∂θ+−i
2θ+(∂0+∂1) (3.5.2)
and the supersymmetry transformation is defined as δ=−ξ−Q++¯ξ−Q+, where ξ−,ξ−are Grassmann variables.
These commute with another set of superderivatives

obeying D2
+=D2
+= 0,{D+,D+}=i(∂0+∂1). For simplicity, we also introduce ∂±= (∂0±∂1)/2and
x±=x0±x1.
There are three kinds of N= (0,2)superfields that we are interested in are the vector, chiral and Fermi superfields.
Chiral superfield AnN= (0,2)chiral superfield Φconsists of a complex scalar ϕand a fermion ψ+obeying
D+Φ = 0 ,Φ =ϕ+θ+ψ+−iθ+θ+∂+ϕ (3.5.4)
The supersymmetry transformation is given as
δϕ=−ξ−ψ+, δψ = 2i¯ξ−∂+ϕ. (3.5.5)
The supersymmetric Lagrangian is

Fermi superfield A Fermi superfield Λ = ( η−, G)consists of a fermion η−and an auxiliary field G. It obeys
D+Λ =E(Φ), (3.5.7)
where E(Φ)is a holomorphic function of the chiral superfields Φ. Note that this condition is compatible because
D+D+Λ = D+E(Φ) = 0 . (3.5.8)
In component fields, the Fermi superfield is expanded as
Λ =η−−θ+G−iθ+¯θ+∂+η−−¯θ+E(Φ). (3.5.9)
and the supersymmetric transformations of the component fields are

.
(3.5.11)
Including a nontrivial E-term induces interactions between the fermions of the chiral and Fermi superfield.
J-term We can introduce another term called the J-term which will induce different interactions between the chiral
and Fermi superfields. Given a set of Fermi and chiral superfields {Λα, Jα(Φ)}, the superfieldP
αΛαJα(Φ)is a
Fermi superfield whenX
αJα(ϕ)Eα(ϕ) = 0(3.5.12)
is obeyed. Under this condition, the following term is also supersymmetric

Note that if (3.5.12) is not obeyed, the Lagrangian is not (0,2)supersymmetric.

CHAPTER 3. GAUGE ORIGAMI 46
J-Eduality After integrating the auxiliary field G, the Lagrangian becomes symmetric in E↔Jand we have a
duality between the J, E-terms. In the superfield formalism, this can be seen as follows. Let Λbe a Fermi superfield
obeying D+Λ =E(Φ). The Lagrangian is written as
S[Λ] =Z
d2xZ
dθ+d¯θ+¯ΛΛ−Z
dθ+ΛJ−Z
d¯θ+¯Λ¯J
=Z
d2x 
−D+D+(¯ΛΛ)−D+(ΛJ) +D+(¯Λ¯J)(3.5.14)
where we used D +∼∂/∂θ+andD+∼ −∂/∂¯θ+up to total derivatives in the bosonic coordinates. We can introduce
a Grassmann superfield Ψto the Lagrangian as
S[Ψ,Λ] =Z
d2x 
−D+D+(¯ΨΨ−Λ¯Ψ−Ψ¯Λ)−D+(ΛJ) +D+(¯Λ¯J)
, (3.5.15)
which reproduces the original Lagrangian after integrating out Ψ. Let us see what will happen if we integrate out Λ
first. We can push the D +,D+inside the Lagrangian multiplier and obtain
S[Ψ,Λ] =Z
d2x 
−D+D+(¯ΨΨ) + D+(E¯Ψ) + D+(ΛD+¯Ψ−ΛJ) +c.c.
. (3.5.16)
Integrating the superfield Λgives
D+Ψ =J(Φ) (3.5.17)
and
S[Ψ] =Z
d2xZ
dθ+d¯θ+ΨΨ +Z
dθ+E(Φ)Ψ +Z
d¯θ+ΨE(Φ)
=Z
d2xZ
dθ+d¯θ+Λ′Λ′+Z
dθ+E(Φ)Λ′+Z
d¯θ+Λ′E(Φ) (3.5.18)
where we defined Λ′=Ψat the second line.
Note that the Fermi superfield Λ′transforms in the conjugate representation of the symmetry groups compared
withΛ. Moreover, because of
Λ =··· − ¯θ+E(Φ),
Λ′=··· − ¯θ+J(Φ),(3.5.19)
the chiral superfield E(Φ) (J(Φ)) has the same quantum numbers with Λ(Λ′) and they are conjugate with each
other. This can also be observed by looking at the interaction term ΛJ. For it to be invariant under a symmetry
transformation, ΛandJ(Φ)needs to transform in a conjugate way.
Vector superfield Since we are interested in supersymmetric gauge theories, we need to include vector multiplets
to the theory. A vector superfield V= (v0, v1, λ−,¯λ−, D)consists of a two-dimensional gauge field v0,1, a fermion
λ−,λ−, and an auxiliary scalar field Dtransforming in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. In this thesis,
we will always keep the group structure to be unitary groups U(n).
The supersymmetry algebra will be modified to a gauge covariant one:
D2
+=D2
+= 0,{D+,D+}=i(D0+D1), (3.5.20)
where D0,1are gauge covariant superderivatives associated with ∂0, ∂1. Namely, when restricted on x0,1, they will
reduce to the gauge covariant differential operators D0,1=∂0,1+iv0,1. Using the parametrization
D+=e−ΩD+eΩ,D+=e−ΩD+eΩ(3.5.21)
and choosing the Wess–Zumino gauge
Ω =−1

the operators are
D+=∂
∂θ+−i
2¯θ+(D0+D1)D+=−∂
∂¯θ++i
2θ+(D0+D1). (3.5.23)
Under this gauge, we have D0+D1=D0+D1. The vector superfield is then defined as D0− D 1=∂0−∂1+iV
where we can write it in component fields as
V=v0−v1−iθ+¯λ−−i¯θ+λ−+θ+¯θ+D. (3.5.24)
The supersymmetry transformation is given as
δv0=−δv1=i

δλ−=ξ−(F01+iD),
δD=1
2ξ−(D0+D1)¯λ−−1
2¯ξ−(D0+D1)λ−.(3.5.25)
The field strength is defined as
Υ = [D,D0− D 1] =−λ−+θ+(F01+iD) +i
2θ+¯θ+(D0+D1)λ− (3.5.26)
where F01= (∂0v1−∂1v0+i[v0, v1]) =−i[D0, D1]. The gauge invariant supersymmetric Lagrangian is then given
as

dθ+TrΥ|¯θ+=0+c.c.=−rZ
d2xTrD (3.5.28)
where we assumed rto be real.
Gauge covariant chiral and Fermi superfields To obtain gauge covariant chiral superfields and Fermi superfields,
we need to modify the differential operators to gauge covariant differential operators:
D+Φ = 0 ,D+Λ−=E(Φ). (3.5.29)
In components fields, we just need to modify the operators as ∂0,1→D0,1. Moreover, the component fields and
superfields transform under a representation of the gauge group.
The Lagrangian of the supersymmetric gauge theory is then summarized as

CHAPTER 3. GAUGE ORIGAMI 48
Quiver gauge theory Let us consider a special class of 2d N= (0,2)gauge theories where the data of the gauge
theory is encoded in a quiver diagram. Given a quiver Q= (Q0,Q1), where Q0is a set of nodes and Q1is a set of
edges, the information of the gauge symmetry and matter fields can be obtained as follows.
• For each node a, a group U(Na)is assigned.
• Edges connect the nodes and there are two sets of oriented edges colored in black and red. We denote the set of
black edges as Q(0)
1while set of red edges are denoted as Q(1)
1.
• A black oriented edge from a source node ato a terminal node brepresents a chiral superfield Φba= Φ b←a
transforming in the bifundamental representation (Na, Nb)ofU(Na)×U(Nb).
• A red oriented edge connecting two nodes a, brepresents a Fermi superfield Λba= Λ b←atransforming in the
bifundamental representation (Na, Nb)ofU(Na)×U(Nb).8
We note that as in usual quiver gauge theories, circle nodes give gauge symmetries while square nodes give the flavor
symmetries. Moreover, self-loop nodes transform in the adjoint representation. An example of the quiver diagram is
(3.5.33)
The quiver diagram itself does not encode the E, J -terms and so we need to include them additionally.
N= (2,2)→ N = (0,2)decomposition The 2d N= (0,2)system discussed above actually can be understood
as a reduction of the 2d N= (2,2)theory which is a dimensional reduction of the 4d N= 1 theory. This time, we
will have four supercharges Q±,Q±obeying
{Q±,Q±}=−2i∂±. (3.5.34)
Similarly, we can further introduce another set of superderivatives D ±,D±obeying
{D±,D±}= 2i∂±. (3.5.35)
There will be three basic N= (2,2)superfields: chiral, twisted chiral9, and vector superfields.
For simplicity, let us focus only on the chiral superfield. The chiral superfield is defined by the condition
D±Φ = 0 ,Φ(x±, θ±,¯θ±) =ϕ(y±) +θαψα(y±) +θ+θ−F(y±) (3.5.36)
where y±=x±−iθ±¯θ±. Note that the anti-chiral superfield is given by D±Φ = 0 . The kinetic term of a supersym-
metric Lagrangian is given as
Schiral=Z
d2xZ
d4θΦΦ =Z
d2x 
|∂0ϕ|2− |∂1ϕ|2+i¯ψ−(∂0+∂1)ψ−+i¯ψ+(∂0−∂1)ψ++|F|2
.
(3.5.37)
We can add interaction terms using the so-called superpotential , which is a holomorphic function of the chiral super-
fields Φ, as
SW=Z
d2xZ
d2θW(Φ) + c.c=Z
d2x(W′(ϕ)F−W′′(ϕ)ψ+ψ−+c.c.). (3.5.38)
8In the context of N= (0,2)quiver gauge theories, the Fermi superfields are sometimes denoted using unoriented edges reflecting the fact
that for the Fermi superfields, we will always have the conjugate Λbatransforming in (Na,Nb)ofU(Na)×U(Nb). This also can be seen from
the fact that there is a duality between the J, E-terms as mentioned in (3.5.18), (3.5.14) and the quantum number of them are conjugate with each
other.
9We will not consider this type of superfield in this thesis.

Combining both terms and integrating out the auxiliary field Fgives
F=−W′(¯ϕ). (3.5.39)
The vacuum of the scalar potential then comes from
∂W(ϕ)
∂ϕ= 0 (3.5.40)
which is usually called the F-term condition.
By looking at the component fields and the supersymmetric Lagrangian and comparing with (3.5.6), (3.5.11), one
can observe that the N= (2,2)chiral multiplet Φ(2,2)= (ϕ, ψ±, F)can be decomposed into a N= (0,2)chiral
multiplet Φ(0,2)= (ϕ, ψ+)and a Fermi multiplet Λ−= (ψ−, F)with the E-term E(Φ) = 0 . Indeed we have
S(0,2)
chiral+S(0,2)
Fermi=S(2,2)
chiral. (3.5.41)
Moreover, the N= (2,2)superpotential term is related with the N= (0,2)J-term as
J(ϕ) =∂W(ϕ) (3.5.42)
because of
SW=Z
d2x(W′(ϕ)F−W′′(ϕ)ψ+ψ−+c.c.)
=Z
d2x(ψ−∂iJ(ϕ)ψ++FJ(ϕ) +c.c.) =SJ-term.(3.5.43)
Including the vector multiplet makes the discussion complicated so we will not discuss it explicitly, so see [Wit93].
TheN= (2,2)vector multiplet V(2,2)will at the end decompose into a N= (0,2)vector multiplet V(0,2)and a
N= (0,2)chiral multiplet Σ(0,2)(of course in the adjoint representation). The gauge interactions will modify the
decomposition of the N= (2,2)chiral multiplets Φ(2,2)transforming under a some representation of the gauge group
into a chiral multiplet Φ(0,2)and a Fermi multiplet Λ(0,2)transforming under the same representation. This time the
E-term will be modified to
E= Σ(0,2)Φ(0,2). (3.5.44)
TheJ-term is not modified and the relation is simply J=∂W. The traceless condition (3.5.12) simply means that
the superpotential is gauge invariant and thus it is automatically satisfied for N= (2,2)theories. Let us summarize
the above results in a table:
N= (2,2) N= (0,2)
vector V(2,2)vector V(0,2)
chiral Σ(0,2)
chiral Φ(2,2)chiral Φ(0,2)
Fermi Λ(0,2)
E-term E= Σ(0,2)·Φ(0,2)
superpotential W J -term J=∂W(3.5.45)
We can further consider quiver gauge theories with four supersymmetries. Let Q= (Q0, Q1)be a quiver, where
Q0is a set of nodes and Q1is a set of edges. The matter fields are described as follows.
• For each node a, a group U(Na)is assigned.
• There is only one type of edges connecting the nodes.
• An oriented edge from a source node ato a terminal node brepresents a N= (0,2)chiral superfield Φba=
Φb←atransforming in the bifundamental representation (Na, Nb)ofU(Na)×U(Nb).

Similar to the (0,2)quiver gauge theory, circle nodes give gauge symmetries while square nodes give flavor symme-

3.5.2 Magnificent four
Let us consider the low energy field theory of kD1-branes probing nD9-branes wrapping the entire C4. Based on the
discussion section 3.4.1, we have a chiral superfield corresponding to the degrees of freedom coming from the open
string connecting the D9-branes and D1-branes, which we denote Φ4=I+···, where Iis the first component field of
the chiral superfield. As mentioned, we need to have the nontrivial B-field so that we have this chiral superfield.
The degrees of freedom coming from the 1-1 strings come from dimensional reduction of the 4d N= 4SYM and
we will have a vector superfield Υ, four chiral superfields Φa=Ba+···fora∈4, where Baare the first component
field and three Fermi superfields Λ1,2,3. In the following discussions, we will also identify the chiral superfields with
the first bosonic component fields.
Since we have multiple D-branes now, the Chan-Paton factors will introduce a group structure and the D1-branes
will give U(k)gauge symmetry. The D9-branes are heavy enough and thus the gauge symmetry is frozen and it will
only induce a global flavor U(n)symmetry. The chiral superfield Ithen transforms under (n, k), while the other chiral
and Fermi superfields Ba,Λiall transform in the adjoint representation of U(k). The matter components of this field
theory are then summarized in the following quiver diagram:

TheE, J -terms are given by
Ei= [B4,Bi]Ji=1
2εijk4[Bj,Bk] (3.5.48)
fori= 1,2,3. The E, J -terms above are obtained by dimensional reduction of the world volume theory of the
D1-branes with no D9-branes. The 2 SUSY condition (3.5.12) can be checked as
Tr(J1E1+J2E2+J3E3) =Tr([B2,B3][B4,B1] + [B3,B1][B4,B2] + [B1,B2][B4,B3])
= 0.(3.5.49)
We then can write down the Lagrangian of the low-energy worldvolume theory in terms of the 2d N= (0,2)super-

vacuum has a positive energy and will break supersymmetry. When r= 0, it will preserve supersymmetry. When
r >0, the original string theory is not supersymmetric but it will restore supersymmetry after tachyon condensation.

3.5.3 Tetrahedron instanton
Before moving on to the general case of tetrahedron instanton, let us focus on the case when we have n¯4D7-branes
wrapping the complex three-plane C3

chiral superfield Φ(2,2)
¯4=I+···in the bifundamental representation (n¯4, k). Similarly, we identify the superfields
with the first component field. The superpotential comes from the dimensional reduction of the 4d N= 4SYM. The
chiral superfield Igives no extra term because there is no other gauge invariant term.

i =Bi+···,Λi(i= 1,2,3)andΦ(2,2)
¯4→Φ(0,2)
¯4=I+···,ΛI. The
N= (2,2)vector superfield decomposes into a N= (0,2)vector superfield and a chiral superfield Φ(0,2)
4=B4+···.
TheE-terms are derived by using (3.5.44), (3.5.45). The J-terms are obtained by using (3.5.42), (3.5.45). Note that
the traceless condition (3.5.12) is similar to the magnificent four case and indeed we have Tr (P3
i=1JiEi) = 0 .
Tetrahedron instanton case Let us generalize the story to the tetrahedron instanton case. We have n¯aD7¯a-branes
andkD1-branes. For each D 7¯a(a∈4), the 1-7 strings give a chiral superfield Φ¯a=I¯a+···and a Fermi superfield
Λ¯atransforming in the bifundamental representation of U(n¯a)×U(k). The matter components coming from the 1-1
strings are one vector superfield Υ, four adjoint chiral superfields Φa, and three Fermi supefields Λi, where we used
the same notation with the magnificent four case. The matter components and the J, E-terms are summarized as
k
n¯4n¯1n¯2
n¯3Ei= [B4,Bi], E I¯a=BaI¯a
Ji=1
2εijk4[Bj,Bk](3.5.57)
We chose a notation so that the E, J -terms in (3.5.56) when we have only one stack of D7 ¯4-branes setup naturally
arise. Similarly, it is obvious that we have Tr (P3
i=1JiEi) = 0 .

3.5.4 Spiked instanton
Let us consider the low energy effective field theory of the kD1-branes probing n12D5-branes wrapping the complex
two plane C2

components are summarized as

The matter components coming from the 1-1 strings are the same as (3.5.55): a N= (2,2)vector superfield and three
adjoint chiral superfields Φ(2,2)
1,2,3=B1,2,3+···. In this case, the 1-5 strings give two chiral superfields Φ(2,2)
12=I+···
andeΦ(2,2)
12=J+···transforming in the bifundamental representations (n12, k)and(n12,¯k), respectively. In this
case, the superpotential is modified by an extra term WFwhich is obviously a gauge invariant term and thus can be
added to the superpotential.
In the 2 SUSY notation, we have

B3,Λ3 B4kEi= [B4,Bi], E I=B4I, E J=−JB4,

J3= [B1,B2] +IJ, J I=JB3, J J=B3I(3.5.64)
where the N= (2,2)chiral superfields are decomposed into N= (0,2)chiral superfields and Fermi superfields
which are denoted as Φ12=I+···,eΦ12=J+···andΛI,ΛJ, respectively. Other components are the same with the
tetrahedron instanton and the magnificent four cases.
TheE, J -terms are obtained by using the relation (3.5.42) and (3.5.44). The existence of the extra superpotential
term WFmodifies the J-term coupled with the Fermi superfield Λ3because of

4 SUSY setup Let us consider a spiked instanton setup with D5-branes wrapping complex two-planes inside C3
123.
We put nAD5-branes wrapping the complex two-plane C2

branes. This setup preserves four supersymmetries and the quiver diagram is modified to

For each stack of D5 A-branes ( A∈ {12,13,23}), the 1-5 strings give N= (2,2)chiral superfields Φ(2,2)
A=IA+···
andeΦ(2,2)
A=JA+···. The matter components of the 1-1 strings are the same as the previous setup. Each stack of
D5A-branes for A∈ {12,13,23}introduces an extra term to the superpotential similar to the previous case and we
have
WF=Tr(J23B1I23) +Tr(J13B2I13) +Tr(J12B3I12). (3.5.68)
In the 2 SUSY convention, the E, J -terms are determined as
E1,2,3= [B4,B1,2,3], E IA=B4IA, E JA=−JAB4, A∈ {12,23,13}
Ji=∂W
∂Bi=εijk4BjBk+Ii4Ji4, J Ii4=Ji4Bi, J Ji4=BiIi4(3.5.69)
fori= 1,2,3. The explicit 2 SUSY quiver diagram of this setup is obtained as a specialization of (3.5.70) by setting
n14=n24=n34= 0there.
Spiked instanton case Let us consider the most generic setup where we have six stacks of nAD5A-branes wrapping
the complex two-planes C2
AforA∈6. The 1-5 Astrings give N= (0 ,2)chiral superfields ΦA=IA+···,
eΦA=JA+···and Fermi superfields ΛA= Λ IA,eΛA= Λ JA. The components coming from 1-1 strings are the same
as the previous setups. They are summarized as the following quiver diagram:

where i= 1,2,3. In fact, under these definitions, one can check that the traceless condition (3.5.12) is indeed obeyed.
Moreover, using the quadrality symmetry and the J-Eduality, one also confirm that the previous setups preserving
four supersymmetries can be reproduced from this definition.

Chapter 4
Gauge Origami partition functions
The goal of this chapter is to derive the gauge origami partition functions by performing as what we did for the
pure SYM case in Chap. 2. As discussed in the previous chapter, the low energy field theory of the kD1-branes is
described by a N= (0,2)quiver gauge theory. Since these D1-branes play the roles of instantons in the D (2p+ 1) -
branes wrapping holomorphic cycles in C4, the partition function is expected to be the partition function of this 2d
theory. We will derive contour integral formulas and explicitly evaluate them.
In the pure SYM case, the U(1) charges q1,2of the ADHM variables played an important role. This is also the case
for the gauge origami system. After discussing general aspects of the flavor symmetries, we explicitly derive the flavor
charges of each gauge origami system in section 4.1. Instead of considering the 2d theory, we them take the T-duality
and consider the supersymmetric quantum mechanics of this 2 SUSY theory in section 4.2. The partition function is
now the Witten index of this supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Explicit contour integral formulas for it are given
in section 4.2. We then use the JK residue prescription to evaluate these contour integral formulas in section 4.3. The
relations of the JK-residue and the index formalism are discussed in section 4.4. The existence of sign rules of the
magnificent four system is also discussed there.
4.1 Flavor symmetries
As discussed in Chap. 3, instantons in the gauge origami system are described by D1-branes wrapping R1,1and
probing D (2p+ 1) ( p= 2,3,4)branes wrapping R1,1and non-compact complex planes in the C4. Moreover, the low
energy world volume theory of the kD1-branes is a 2d N= (0,2)quiver gauge theory and its vacuum moduli space
coincides with the k-instanton moduli space of the gauge origami system (see section 3.1). The flavor symmetries of
the 2d N= (0,2)quiver gauge theory is therefore directly related to the flavor symmetries of the instanton moduli
space.
LetVchiral andVFermi be representations of the gauge group G. The chiral superfields Φbelong to Vchiral and the
Fermi superfields Λbelong to VFermi. The E-term is a VFermi valued holomorphic function of Φ, i.e.E:Vchiral→VFermi.
TheJ-term is a V∗
Fermi valued holomorphic function of Φ, i.e.J:Vchiral→V∗
Fermi. Assume that we have a set of unitary
transformations hc, hfacting on Vchiral, VFermi that commute with the gauge group. We denote the flavor symmetry
group as GFand it is defined as a symmetry obeying
E(hcΦ) = hfE(Φ), J(hcΦ) = J(Φ)h−1
f. (4.1.1)
The chiral and Fermi multiplets transform as (ϕ, ψ+)→(hcϕ, h cψ+)and(η−, G)→(hFη−, hFG). Note also that
this is compatible with the fact that the E, J terms have the conjugated quantum numbers.
For the gauge origami system, we have a U(1)4global symmetry induced from the rotationQ
a∈4SO(2) arotating
C4. Let us explicitly derive the flavor symmetries for each setup.

CHAPTER 4. GAUGE ORIGAMI PARTITION FUNCTIONS 60
4.2 Supersymmetric quantum mechanics and Witten index
To obtain the gauge origami instanton partition functions, one needs to compute the elliptic genus of the 2d N= (0,2)
quiver gauge theories. Namely, we take the R1,1part to be a torus T2and study the partition function of the 2d theory
on it. General discussions on how to compute the elliptic genus of a given 2d N= (0,2)quiver gauge theory were
done in [BEHT13b, BEHT13a]. When computing the elliptic genus, we have a parameter pwhich is the exponent
of the complex structure τofT2. The elliptic genus is then a function of this parameter pand furthermore it will be
written in theta functions.
Instead of considering the D1-branes in the type IIB string theory, from now on we will take the T-duality along the
9-direction and consider the D0–D (2p)(p= 2,3,4) setup in this section. Namely, the magnificent four, tetrahedron
instanton, and spiked instanton setups will be the D0–D8, D0–D6 ¯a, D0–D4 Abrane setups. The low energy field
theory of the D0-branes will be a dimensional reduction of the 2d N= (0,2)quiver gauge theory which is the 1d
N= 2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The partition function of the theory is then described by the flavored
Witten indices of these supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
Before moving on to the explicit evaluation of the Witten indices for the gauge origami system, let us briefly
summarize the basic components to compute the Witten indices for general quiver gauge theories [HKY14, HKKP14,
OS14, CS14].
Supersymmetric quantum mechanics The supersymmetric quantum mechanics of a given 2d N= (0,2)quiver
gauge theory is obtained by the dimensional reduction of section 3.5.1. To do this, one simply assumes that all the
fields are independent on the x1-coordinate and lose the differential operators depending on ∂1. We basically follow
the notations in [HKY14]. We denote the two supercharges and the fermionic coordinates as Q+→Q,Q+→Q, and
θ+→θ,¯θ+→¯θ. In the superfield description, the differential operators are
Q=∂
∂θ+i
2θ∂
∂t,Q=−∂
∂θ−i
2θ∂
∂t,D=∂
∂θ−i
2θ∂
∂t,D=−∂
∂θ+i

∂t. (4.2.1)
The matter components we are interested in are the same as the 2d case: vector superfield, chiral superfield, and
Fermi-superfield.
• Vector superfield and field strength V= (vt, σ, λ, ¯λ, D),Υ:
V= (vt−σ)−iθ¯λ−i¯θλ+θ¯θD,

All the properties discussed in section 3.5.1 appear also in the SQM. Namely, we also have the J, E-duality, the
vacuum moduli space is described as (3.5.31), we can also consider quiver gauge theories using the same quiver
diagram, and the flavor symmetries are all the same as section 4.1.
Witten index Given the supersymmetric quantum mechanics, the Witten index is defined as
Z(y) =Tr"
(−1)Fe−βHY

a#
(4.2.7)
where Fis the fermion number, {ya=eua}are the fugacities of the flavor symmetry, {Ta}are the Cartan generators
of the flavor symmetry group, and βis the circumference of S1. Let us consider a one-dimensional system described
by a vector multiplet Vwith gauge group G, chiral multiplets Φitransforming in a representation Vchiral ofG×Gf,
and Fermi multiplets Λαtransforming in the representation VFermi ofG×Gf. The Witten index can be derived by
considering the path integral of the Lagrangian10(4.2.6), which eventually breaks down to

and|WG|is the order of the Weyl group of G. The parameter ϕparametrizes the Cartan subalgebra of Gandµ
contains ϕandua. Each contribution is understood as follows. We first consider the index with constant gauge fields
parameterized by ϕI, ua. The supersymmetric Lagrangian given above surprisingly obeys the property S=QV
where Q=Q+Q for some Vand it is a Q-exact term. We then can use supersymmetric localization as explained
in section 2.1 and compute the path integral of the action. The quadratic terms of the chiral and Fermi superfields
only contributes to the superdeterminant as given in (2.1.15) and they give ZΦiandZΛα. The variables inside the
sh(βx)-function comes from the constant gauge fields and sh(βx)appears because we are considering the quantum
mechanics on S1giving Fourier modes such as ei2nπx/β. Since we are considering the index of a gauge theory whose
gauge group is G, the index must be invariant under the gauge transformation. Thus, finally, we need to take the
integral over the ϕvariables. Such contribution gives the vector superfield contribution ZV. We then arrive at the
contour integral formula (4.2.9). Since the contour integral will be generally contour integrals on multi-variables, we
need to specify how to take them. Now it is known that the resulting formalism to take the contour integral formula is
the JK-residue formalism explained in section 2.3. See the original papers [BEHT13b, BEHT13a, HKY14] for details.
In particular, we are interested in the Witten index of 1d N= 2 quiver gauge theories with unitary groups. Let
Q= (Q0,Q1)be the 2 SUSY quiver diagram and Q0,Q1denoting the set of nodes and edges. For use in the gauge
10We take the Wick rotation to perform this path integral.

origami setup, we assume that there is a flavor U(1)3symmetry and turn on the fugacities qi=eϵi. We denote the
U(1)3charges of the chiral, Fermi superfields as q(Φ) = eϵ(Φ),q(Λ) = eϵ(Λ).
The quiver diagram will now be written as discussed in section 4.1. We further have flavor groups drawn in square
nodes and we denote the fugacities of them collectively as {vi=eai}. On the other hand, the exponent of the root of
the gauge group will be denoted as x=eϕand at the end the integral over it will be taken. Under this notations, the
basic factors appearing in the Witten index are determined as follows.

(4.2.16)
One motivation to include this extra Fermi multiplet contribution is to make the degrees of orders of the numerator
and denominator to be the same. In the original paper [Nek17d, NP18], this setup was interpreted as a setup of pairs
of D8-D8-branes with D0-branes. The existence of anti D8-branes makes the group of the D 8-D8theory to look
like a supergroup U(n|n). The parameters {aα}parametrizes the Cartan subalgebra of the U(n|0)part while {bα}
parametrizes the Cartan subalgebra of U(0|n). Physically, the differences of the parameters aα,bβare understood as
the distance between the D8 and D8-branes. From the string theory viewpoint, the existence of the anti D-branes make
the setup nonsupersymmetric. However, after tachyon condensation [Sen98], it is expected that the D8 and D8-branes
annihilate each other eventually leaving a D6-brane extending in one of the three complex three-planes C3
¯a. At the
partition function level, this can be observed by tuning the parameters as bα=aα+ϵafor some a∈4. Actually,
under this restriction, the tetrahedron instanton partition function in Prop. 4.2.3 can be reproduced.
The discussion above can be extended to the case when the appearing theory is a U(n|m)theory [BFF+21]. In
[BFF+21], the authors introduced a stack of nD8-branes and mD8’-branes to the system.12For the D8-branes, we
introduce a constant background field, whose effect is equivalent to the B-field above. On the other hand, for the
D8’-branes, we do not turn on any background field. The open string D0-D8 gives a chiral multiplet while the open
string D0-D8’ gives a Fermi multiplet (see section 3.4.1). Setting n=mactually reproduces the above partition
function.

4.3 Gauge origami and multi-dimensional partitions
We collect basic properties of multi-dimensional partitions in section 4.3.1. Classifications of the poles are given in
the following sections.
4.3.1 Multi-dimensional partitions
Before evaluating the contour integral formulas for the gauge origami partition functions, let us summarize some
notations regarding multi-dimensional partitions. See [Nek17d, NP18, NP23] and also [KN23, Sec. 2] for details.
Young diagrams Generalizing the coordinates given in (2.3.26), we introduce coordinates and multiplicative coor-
dinates as
cab() =a+ (i−1)ϵa+ (j−1)ϵb,
χab,u() =ecab()=uqi−1
aqj−1
b,(4.3.1)
where u=ea. We call the multiplicative coordinates as q-coordinates.

Plane partitions The plane partition is a stack of cubes that obeys a generalization of the condition (2.3.25):
i jk
(4.3.2)
We denote the set of all possible plane partitions as PP.
There are two ways to describe the plane partition: (2,1)-type and (1,2)-type. The (2,1)-type description is to
understand the plane partition πas a 2d partition λπwhere there is a map mapping each box = (i, j)∈λπa number
πi,jobeying the condition
ijk
πi,j
πi,j≥πi+1,j, π i,j≥πi,j+1. (4.3.3)
The size of the plane partition is defined as the number of cubes |π|=P
i,jπi,j. Like the Young diagram case, a cube
in the plane partition πis assigned a coordinate (i, j, k ) (i, j, k≥1)as (4.3.2) and it obeys
(i, j, k )∈π⇔1≤k≤πi,j. (4.3.4)
The other (1,2)-type description is to understand the plane partition as a non-increasing sequence of Young dia-
grams π= (Λ(1),Λ(2), . . . , Λ(h(π))):
i jk
Λ(1)Λ(2)Λ(3)...
Λ(k)= (Λ(k)
1, . . . , Λ(k)
i. . .)
Λ(k)⪰Λ(k+1),∀k(4.3.5)
where Λ(k)⪰Λ(k+1)means ∀(i, j)∈Λ(k+1)⇒(i, j)∈Λ(k)andh(π)is the height of the plane partition which is
defined as
h(π) = min {k≥0|(1,1, k+ 1)̸∈π}. (4.3.6)
The size in this description is given as |π|=P
k|Λ(k)|. Similarly, the = (i, j, k )in the plane partition obeys the
condition
(i, j, k )∈π⇔1≤j≤Λ(k)
i. (4.3.7)

Figure 4.1: Coordinates of the plane partition
For later use, we introduce coordinates to each cubes in the plane partition. Given three parameters ϵa,b,c, for a box
in the plane partition = (i, j, k )we define
cabc() =cabc(a,(i, j, k )) =a+ (i−1)ϵa+ (j−1)ϵb+ (k−1)ϵc (4.3.8)
where ais some complex parameter. We also define the q-coordinates as
χabc,u() =ecabc()=uqi−1

c. (4.3.9)
Solid partitions A solid partition is a four-dimensional analog of the Young diagram and plane partition. It is a stack
of hyper-cubes obeying similar conditions to (2.3.25) and (4.3.3). We denote the set of all possible solid partitions as
SP. We have three ways to describe the solid partition: (3,1),(2,2), and (1,3)-types. We only discuss the (3,1)and
(1,3)-type descriptions.
1.(3,1)-type: This description is similar to the plane partition’s (2,1)-type description. We project the solid
partition to a plane partition πρand for each cube (i, j, k )∈πρ, a height function ρi,j,kis defined. The height
function obeys the condition
ρi,j,k≥ρi+1,j,k, ρ i,j,k≥ρi,j+1,k, ρ i,j,k≥ρi,j,k+1. (4.3.10)
The size is defined as
|ρ|=X
(i,j,k)∈πρρi,j,k. (4.3.11)
4-cubes in the solid partition are assigned coordinates in a natural way (i, j, k, l )and obey
(i, j, k, l )∈ρ⇔1≤l≤ρi,j,k. (4.3.12)
2.(1,3)-type: This description resembles the (1,2)-type description of plane partition. The solid partition is
understood as non-increasing sequences of plane partitions (see Figure 4.2):
ρ= (Π(1),Π(2), . . . , ),Π(l)⪰Π(l+1)(4.3.13)
where Π(l)⪰Π(l+1)means
(i, j, k )∈Π(l+1)⇒(i, j, k )∈Π(l). (4.3.14)
Under this description, the size is defined as
|ρ|=X
l|Π(l)| (4.3.15)
and obviously,
(i, j, k, l )∈ρ⇔(i, j, k )∈Π(l). (4.3.16)

Figure 4.2: (1,3)-type description of the solid partition. The horizontal axis is one of the four axes of the solid
partition. The solid partition is decomposed into multiple plane partitions Π(1),Π(2), . . ..
Similar to the previous cases, we define coordinates to the hypercubes in the solid partition as
c4() =c4(a,(i, j, k, l )) =a+ (i−1)ϵ1+ (j−1)ϵ2+ (k−1)ϵ3+ (l−1)ϵ4,
χ4,u() =ec4()=uqi−1
1qj−1
2qk−1
3ql−1
4.(4.3.17)
Ordering of boxes For later use, let us define an ordering in the boxes included in the multi-dimensional partitions.
The ordering for boxes in the solid partition is defined as
(i, j, k, l )<(i′, j′, k′, l′)
⇔(l < l′)∨(l=l′, k < k′)∨(l=l′, k=k′, j < j′)∨(l=l′, k=k′, j=j′, i < i′).(4.3.18)
This ordering define a monomial ordering in the q-coordinates qi−1
1qj−1
2qk−1
3ql−1
4.
For the orderings of the boxes in the plane partition, we first embed the plane partition in the solid partition and
induce the ordering defined on the solid partitions. There are three ways to embed the plane partition in the solid
partition depending on which three axes the plane partition spans. When considering plane partitions, we implicitly
assume that this embedding is also specified. We denote the set of plane partitions not extending in the a∈4direction
asPPa=PP¯a.
Similarly, for Young diagrams, we embed them into the solid partition and induce the ordering. There are six ways
to embed the Young diagram to the solid partition depending on which two axes the Young diagram spans. Similarly,
when considering the Young diagrams, we implicitly assume that this embedding is also specified. The set of Young
diagrams extending in the ab∈6directions is denoted as PA(A∈6).
4.3.2 Magnificent four and solid partitions
Let us evaluate (4.2.16) using the JK residue formalism. The discussion here is based on [NP18]. At the end of
evaluation, we will see that similar to the pure SYM case, the poles giving non-zero JK-residues are classified by solid
partitions.
The denominator in (4.2.16) shows that the poles come from the hyperplanes
HI,α={ϕI−aα= 0}, H IJ,a=1,2,3,4={ϕI−ϕJ−ϵa= 0}, (4.3.19)
where the corresponding charge vectors are now {eI}and{eI−eJ}. Compared to the pure super Yang–Mills
case in section 2.3, the difference is that we do not have {−eI}and thus Lemma 2.3.1 is automatically satisfied.13
Lemma 2.3.2 tells us that the poles come from an oriented tree made by {eI}and{eI−eJ}. The main claim of this
section is that the poles will be classified by solid partitions.
13This also means that if we set the reference vector to be η= (−1,···,−1), the partition function vanishes, which is a property different
from the pure SYM case. For the pure SYM case, even if we set the reference vector to be η= (−1,···,−1), the partition function does not
vanish and actually we still have the same partition function.

CHAPTER 4. GAUGE ORIGAMI PARTITION FUNCTIONS 68
Theorem 4.3.1. The poles of (4.2.16) are classified by n-tuples of solid partitions ⃗ ρ={ρ(α)}n
α=1:
{ϕI}k
I=1→ {c4()|= (x1, x2, x3, x4)∈ρ(α)}n
α=1 (4.3.20)
where c4() =aα+P
a∈4(xa−1)ϵaandkcorresponds to the total number of boxes in the n-tuples of solid partitions:
k=Pn
α=1|ρ(α)|.
Proof. We show this by induction. For the k= 1case, the pole will simply come from ϕ1−aα= 0for some αand
it corresponds to configuration with one nonempty solid partition with only one box. Assume that the kindependent
hyperplane equations determining the poles are {Q1, . . .Qk}and they form a tree structure as Lemma 2.3.2. By the
induction hypothesis, the k−1poles are determined by the solid partition rule. We need to show that under these
assumptions, the k-th pole will also obey the solid partition rule.
When the trees have no branches, all the poles will be determined by {ϕI−aα= 0}. This is a situation when we
haveknonempty solid partitions where each of them has only one box. This case indeed obeys the solid partition rule.
Let us consider the case when Qk=eI−eJfor some I, J is a branch at the end of tree, and when the corre-
sponding hyperplane determine the pole of ϕI. Using the Weyl invariance, we can assume that {ϕ1, . . . , ϕ k−1}are
determined by {Q1, . . . ,Qk−1}andϕkis the last pole determined by Qk=ek−eJfor some J. The induction
hypothesis tells us that {ϕ1, . . . , ϕ k−1}are classified by solid partitions ⃗ ρwithk−1boxes. Let us show that the
possible choices of Qkcorrespond to the possible choices to a add box to ⃗ ρgiving ⃗ ρ′=⃗ ρ+.
We assume that ekbelongs to a tree whose root vertex corresponds to the pole at a∗and denote the corresponding
solid partitions ρ∗, ρ′
∗=ρ+. When evaluating the pole ϕk, poles at {ϕ1, . . . , ϕ k−1}=⃗ ρare inserted and the related

a∈4(xa−1)ϵa. Note that other factors appearing from (4.2.16) are regular and will not affect
the pole structure and thus we omit them.
Since Qk=ek−eJdetermines the last pole ϕk, the pole we are interested takes the form as ϕk=ϕJ+ϵ1,2,3,4.
For later use, we denote the position of the boxes corresponding to ϕk, ϕJasx′= (x′

Under this situation, we have the following properties.
•ϕJneeds to be in the boundary14andϕkis not included in the solid partition. If ϕkis already in the solid
partition, then ϕk=ϕJ+ϵc=ϕJ′for some J′< k. Namely, we have x+δc∈ρ∗, where δcis a four

• When x∈ρ∗belongs to the boundary and x1=x2= 1, x3>1, x4>1(other situations are obtained

(1,1, x3−1, x4)∈ρ∗. Note that this means that
ϕk=c4(a∗, x) +ϵ4=c4(a∗,(1,1, x3−1, x4)) +ϵ3+ϵ4. (4.3.25)
We have two possibilities of the position of (x3, x4+ 1) .

• When x∈ρ∗belongs to the boundary and x1= 1, x2,3,4>1(other situations are obtained by the triality
between x1,2,3), the induction hypothesis gives (1, x2−1, x3, x4),(1, x2, x3−1, x4)∈ρ∗, which means
ϕk=c4(a∗, x) +ϵ4=c4(a∗, x−δ2) +ϵ24=c4(a, x−δ3) +ϵ34. (4.3.29)
The partition ρ′
∗is a solid partition if and only if
(1, x2−1, x3, x4+ 1),(1, x2, x3−1, x4+ 1)∈ρ∗. (4.3.30)
Unless this situation, the JK residue will be zero:

sh(ϕk−c4(a∗, x−δ3+δ4)−ϵ3)=1

because the two numerators are canceled only if we have the blue terms which come from the condition (4.3.30).
This situation is illustrated as

(4.3.32)
where the blue and red boxes correspond to the poles ϕJ=c4(a, x)andϕk=c4(a, x+δ4), respectively.

where the blue and red boxes correspond to the poles ϕJ=c4(a, x)andϕk=c4(a, x+δ4), respectively.
This concludes the inductive proof and the non-zero JK residues are indeed classified by n-tuples of solid partitions.
Similar to the pure SYM case, from the proof of the classification, the JK-residue can be written as an iterative
residue. For simplicity, let us focus on the n= 1case. Thm. 4.3.1 claims that the poles giving the k-instanton sector
are classified by a solid partition with k-boxes. The inductive process in k−1→kshows that after evaluating the
residue at the level k−1, the position of the remaining pole at level kis given by the possible positions to add a box to
the solid partition. Moreover, each iterative process will obey the solid partition rule. Concretely, let {ϕ1∗, . . . , ϕ k∗}
be the sequence of the coordinates of the k-boxes in the solid partition ordered in the order they are stacked to the solid
partition. Each subset {ϕ1∗, . . . , ϕ i∗}is a solid partition with i-boxes and the contour integral can then be evaluated
asH
ϕk=ϕk∗dϕk···H
ϕ1=ϕ1∗dϕ1. Given a solid partition ρ, we may have multiple ways to stack boxes by keeping the
solid partition condition for each step. However, the result does not depend on them. Thus, it is useful to fix one
ordering to evaluate the contour integral and we choose the ordering given in (4.3.18). Obviously, the ordering given
there preserves the solid partition condition for each step. The U(1|1)magnificent four partition is then given as
ZD8

ρ∈SPq|ρ|ZD8[ρ],ZD8[ρ] = Res
ϕ=ϕρµD8-D0

ϕk=ϕk∗···Res
ϕ2=ϕ2∗Res
ϕ1=ϕ1∗µD8-D0
k(a,b, ϕI) (4.3.39)
andk=|ρ|. The sequence {ϕ1∗, . . . , ϕ k∗}is the coordinates of the boxes in the solid partition ordered in the ordering
(4.3.18). For higher rank cases, the discussion in the pure SYM case is straightforwardly applicable so we omit the
discussion.
4.3.3 Tetrahedron instantons and plane partitions
Let us evaluate the contour integral (4.2.19). As mentioned before, this contour integral formula can be obtained from
(4.2.16) by tuning the parameter bαof the U(n|n)magnificent four setup. We first consider the rank n=P
a∈4n¯a
magnificent four setup and then take the specialization
{aα}n
α=1→ {a¯a,α}a∈4,α=1,...,n ¯a,{bβ}n
β=1→ {a¯a,α+ϵa}a∈4,α=1,...,n ¯a. (4.3.40)
The classification of the poles for this setup was done in [PYZ21]. Similar to the magnificent four setup, the poles
come from the hyperplanes
HI,¯a,α={ϕI−a¯a,α= 0}, H IJ,a=1,2,3,4={ϕI−ϕJ−ϵ1,2,3,4= 0} (4.3.41)
and the charge vectors {eI},{eI−eJ}. Again, we do not have the anti-fundamental contributions {−eI}and
Lemma 2.3.1 is automatically satisfied. The poles will then be classified by the oriented tree structure given in
Lemma 2.3.2. The poles will actually be classified by plane partitions which are truncations of the solid partitions.
Theorem 4.3.2. The poles of (4.2.19) are classified by plane partitions ⃗ π= (⃗ πa)a∈4= (π(α)
¯a)α=1,...,n ¯a
a∈4 :
{ϕI}k
I=1→ {c¯a()|= (xi, xj, xk)∈π(α)
¯a,(i, j, k )∈¯a}α=1,...,n ¯a
a∈4(4.3.42)
where c¯a() =a¯a,α+P
i∈¯a(xi−1)ϵi. Namely, the n¯a-tuples of plane partitions extend in the three-dimensional
subspace (xi, xj, xk), where ¯a=ijk. The total instanton number kis identified with the number of boxes of the plane
partitions k=P
a∈4Pn¯a
α=1|π(α)
¯a|.
Proof. The proof is done similarly as the magnificent four setup and we show the claim by induction. For k= 1, the
pole will come from ϕ1−a¯a,α= 0and it corresponds to a configuration with one nonempty plane partition with only
one box.

CHAPTER 4. GAUGE ORIGAMI PARTITION FUNCTIONS 72
Fork >1, we assume that the kindependent hyperplane equations come from {Q1, . . . ,Qk}and its associated
tree structure. From the induction hypothesis, the k−1poles are determined by the plane partition rule. When the
trees have no branches, all the poles will come from {ϕI−a¯a,α= 0}and we have knonempty plane partitions with
one box.
The generic case is when we have a branch at the end of tree. Using the Weyl invariance, we can assume that
{ϕ1, . . . , ϕ k−1}are determined by {Q1, . . . ,Qk}andϕkis the last pole determined by Qk=ek−eJfor some J.
The induction hypothesis shows that {ϕ1, . . . , ϕ k−1}are classified by plane partitions ⃗ πwithk−1boxes. We show
that the possible choices of Qkcorrespond to the possible choices to add a box to ⃗ πgiving ⃗ π′=⃗ π+.
We can assume that ekbelongs to a tree whose root vertex comes from a∗=a¯4,αfor some αand denote the
corresponding plane partitions π∗, π′
∗=π∗+. In this case, the plane partition will span the 123-subspace and the
coordinates will be assigned using ϵ1,2,3. When the root vertex comes from other {a¯a,α}a=1,2,3, the plane partition
spans different three-dimensional subspace of 1234 and we can simply use the quadrality symmetry. At the time we
evaluate ϕk, poles {ϕ1, . . . , ϕ k−1}=⃗ πwill be inserted and the related factor only comes from contribution of π∗and
other contributions will be regular:
sh(ϕk−a∗−ϵ4)
sh(ϕk−a∗)Y

∈ρ∗sh(c¯4()−ϕk) sh(c¯4()−ϕk−ϵ14,24,34)
sh(c¯4()−ϕk−ϵ1,2,3,4),(4.3.43)
where c¯4() =a∗+P3
i=1(xi−1)ϵi. UsingP
a∈4ϵa= 0, this can be rewritten as
sh(ϕk−a∗+ϵ123)
sh(ϕk−a∗)Y
∈ρ∗sh(ϕk−c¯4()) sh( ϕk−c¯4() +ϵ12,23,31)

sh(c¯4()−ϕk−ϵ1,2,3) sh(c¯4()−ϕk+ϵ123).(4.3.44)
The difference with the magnificent four setup is that the numerator sh(ϕk−a∗−ϵ4)gives an extra zero and some
poles in the magnificent four case will be canceled.
The charge vector Qk=ek−eJdetermines the pole as ϕk−ϕJ= +ϵ1,2,3,4. For later use, we denote the position
of the boxes ϕk, ϕJasx′= (x′
1, x′
2, x′
3), x= (x1, x2, x3). The potential poles are then x′=x+ (1,0,0), x+
(0,1,0), x+ (0,0,1), x+ (−1,−1,−1)where we usedP
a∈4ϵa= 0. Using the triality symmetry between ϵ1↔
ϵ2↔ϵ3, it is enough to only consider the potential poles coming from x′=x+ (0,0,1), x+ (−1,−1,−1).
We first consider the situation when the poles comes from x′=x+ (0,0,1).
•ϕkcan not already be included in the plane partition. If this is so, then we have ϕk=ϕJ+ϵ3=ϕJ′for some
J′< k, which gives
sh(ϕk−c¯4(a∗, x+ (0,0,1))) sh( c¯4(a∗, x+ (0,0,1))−ϕk)
sh(ϕk−c¯4(a∗, x)−ϵ3)→0. (4.3.45)
• When x∈π∗belongs to the boundary of the plane partition and x1=x2= 1, x3>1, no pole cancellation
occurs and we have a single pole. This situation is illustrated as
1 23
(4.3.46)
where the blue and red boxes correspond to the poles ϕJ, ϕk, respectively.

• When x∈π∗belongs to the boundary of the plane partition and x1= 1, x2, x3>1(the other situation can be
obtained by switching x1↔x2), we have (1, x2−1, x3)∈π∗. The partition π′
∗is a plane partition if and only
if(1, x2−1, x3+ 1)∈π∗:
sh(c¯4(a∗, x−(0,1,0))−ϕk+ϵ23)

(4.3.47)
where we used
ϕk=c¯4(a∗, x) +ϵ3=c¯4(a∗, x−(0,1,0)) + ϵ23=c¯4(a∗, x+ (0,−1,1)) + ϵ2. (4.3.48)
Since the blue term only appears when π′
∗is a plane partition, the JK residue is non-zero only when this condition
is satisfied. This situation is illustrated as
1 23
(4.3.49)
where the blue and red boxes correspond to the poles ϕJ, ϕk, respectively.
• When x∈π∗belongs to the boundary of the plane partition and x1,2,3>1, we have (x1−1, x2, x3),(x1, x2−
1, x3)∈π∗. The partition π′

(x1−1, x2, x3+ 1),(x1, x2−1, x3+ 1)∈π∗. (4.3.50)
Using
ϕk=c¯4(a∗, x) +ϵ3=c¯4(a, x−(1,0,0)) + ϵ13=c¯4(a, x−(0,1,0)) + ϵ23
=c¯4(a∗, x+ (−1,0,1)) + ϵ1=c¯4(a∗, x+ (0,−1,1)) + ϵ2(4.3.51)
the related factor is
sh(c¯4(a, x−(1,0,0)) + ϵ13−ϕk) sh(c¯4(a, x−(0,1,0)) + ϵ23−ϕk)
sh(ϕk−c¯4(a∗, x)−ϵ3)
×1
sh(ϕk−c¯4(a∗, x+ (−1,0,1))−ϵ1) sh(ϕk−c¯4(a∗, x+ (0,−1,1))−ϵ2)=1
sh(ϕk−c¯4(a∗, x)−ϵ3).
(4.3.52)
The blue term only appears when π′
∗is a plane partition and gives a non-zero JK residue.
1 23
(4.3.53)
where the blue and red boxes correspond to the poles ϕJ, ϕk, respectively.
Finally, let us then consider the case when the pole come from ϕk−ϕJ=ϵ4=−ϵ123x′=x+ (−1,−1,−1).
The residue can be non-zero only if (x1−1, x2, x3)is not in π∗, since otherwise the numerator contain zeros from
sh(ϕk−c¯4(a∗, x−(1,0,0)) + ϵ23). This also shows that (x1, x2−1, x3),(x1, x2, x3−1)are not in π∗. However,

# ページ 74

CHAPTER 4. GAUGE ORIGAMI PARTITION FUNCTIONS 74
this contradicts with the assumption that (x1, x2, x3)∈π∗andπ∗is a plane partition. Therefore, this contribution
will always be canceled.
In summary, the poles giving non-zero JK residues are classified by a collection of plane partitions.
Similar to the magnificent four case, the JK-residue can be written as an iterative residue. For simplicity, let us
consider the case when n¯4= 1 andn¯a= 0 fora̸= 4. The discussion runs similarly and the conclusion is that we
can choose a particular ordering for taking the residue and represent the JK-residue of a given plane partition by the
iterative residue. Let {ϕ1∗,···, ϕk∗}be the sequence of the coordinates of the k-boxes in the plane partition spanning
the 123-directions. We can assume that the ordering is the one given in (4.3.18). The iterative residue is then given byH
ϕk=ϕk∗···H
ϕ1=ϕ1∗. The D6 123U(1) partition function is then given by

k(a, ϕI) = Res
ϕk=ϕk∗···Res
ϕ1=ϕ1∗µD6-D0
k(a, ϕI). (4.3.55)
The discussion for higher rank cases is straightforward so we omit it.
4.3.4 Spiked instantons and Young diagrams
Let us evaluate the contour integral formula given in Prop. 4.2.4. If we specify to the case n12̸= 0, nA= 0 (A̸= 12) ,
then this partition function simply gives the instanton partition function of the 5d N= 1 U( n12)affine quiver gauge
theory defined on C2
12×S1with adjoint mass ϵ3. Generalizing the discussion in section 2.3, the poles of this contour
integral formula actually are classified by Young diagrams. In the pure SYM case, the poles were labeled by Young
diagrams spanning the 12-direction whose coordinates are given by a linear combination of ϵ1,2, but in this case, we
will have six types of Young diagrams spanning A=ab∈6whose coordinates come from ϵa,b.
Theorem 4.3.3. The poles of (4.2.22) are classified by Young diagrams ⃗λ= (⃗λA)A∈6= (λ(α)
A)α=1,...,n A
A∈6 :
{ϕI}k
I=1→ {cA()|= (xa, xb)∈λ(α)
A, A =ab∈6} (4.3.56)
where cab() =aA,α+ (xa−1)ϵa+ (xb−1)ϵb. Namely, the nA-tuples of Young diagrams extend in the two-
dimensional space (xa, xb)forA=ab. The total instanton number kis identified with the number of boxes of the
Young diagrams k=P
A∈6PnA
α=1|λ(α)
A|.
Since the proof is essentially the same with the pure SYM case, we only give a sketch of the induction process and
point out different points compared with the pure SYM case. Lemma 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 tell us that the poles picked up
come from an oriented tree of charge vectors taking elements from {eI}and{eI−eJ}. The situation k= 1is trivial
and we assume that for rank k−1, the Young diagram rule is true. We consider the situation when the root vertex
corresponds to the pole at a∗=a12,αfor some α. In this case, the Young diagram will expand in the 12-direction as the
pure SYM case and other situations are obtained by changing the equivariant parameters ϵ1,2→ϵa,bforA=ab∈6.
The factor determining the pole at ϕkis

sh(c12()−ϕk−ϵ1,2,3,4).(4.3.57)
One can show that the poles coming from ϕk=c12() +ϵ1,2will always give non-zero JK residues as the pure SYM.
The existence of the poles coming from ϕk=c12() +ϵ3,4is the different part. Let us show that the poles coming
from them will always give zero JK residues. Assume that ϕJ=c12(a∗,(x, y))andϕk=ϕJ+ϵ3,4. We then have
the following two cases.

• When ϕJ=a∗, the poles will be canceled by the numerators:
sh(ϕk−a∗−ϵ4) sh(a∗−ϕk+ϵ3)
sh(ϕk−ϕJ−ϵ3) sh(ϕk−ϕJ−ϵ4)= 1 (4.3.58)
• When ϕJ=c12(a∗,(x, y))forx, y > 1and(x, y)∈λ∗. This condition means that (x−1, y),(x, y−1)∈λ∗,
which gives
sh(ϕk−c12(a∗,(x−1, y))−ϵ14) sh(c12(a∗,(x, y−1))−ϕk−ϵ14)
sh(ϕk−ϕJ−ϵ3) sh(ϕk−ϕJ−ϵ3)=−1 (4.3.59)

c12(a∗,(x−1, y)) +ϵ14=c12(a∗,(x, y)) +ϵ4,
c12(a∗,(x−1, y))−ϵ14=c12(a∗,(x, y))−ϵ124=c12(a∗,(x, y)) +ϵ3.(4.3.60)
Therefore, the poles coming from ϕk=c12()+ϵ3,4always disappear and the poles are classified by Young diagrams.
The iterative residue is given similarly as given in (2.3.36) and in particlar for the U(1) D412partition function,

4.4 Description from equivariant index formalism
The JK-residue for each multi-dimensional partition is explicitly derived in this section. We first introduce rational
functions which we call structure functions and then rewrite the contour integral formulas using them. Following
what we did in Chap. 2, we relate the JK-residues with characters and the index of them. Properties of these partition
functions are also discussed.
4.4.1 Structure functions
Before moving on to the evaluation of the gauge origami partition function, let us introduce extra notations and
definitions that frequently will be used from this chapter.
Data We denote the four complex coordinates of C4aszi(i= 1,2,3,4). The Ω-deformation parameters are
qa=eϵa,X
a∈4ϵa= 0,(4.4.1)
where we simply omit the S1radius. This is the Cartan torus of the SU(4) rotational symmetry, which acts on the four
complex coordinates as
(z1, z2, z3, z4)7→(q1z1, q2z2, q3z3, q4z4) (4.4.2)
with the condition q1q2q3q4= 1. We also introduce
Qa=qa,Pa= 1−qa,P∨
a= 1−q−1
a, a∈4 (4.4.3)

a∈SPa.(4.4.4)
For example, we have P12= (1−q1)(1−q2)andP123= (1−q1)(1−q2)(1−q3). Some properties of the index are
q4=q∅= 1,P4=P1P2P3P4, q ¯S=q−1

for any subset S⊆4. Note here, we denote ¯Sas the complement of the subset S. For later use, we also define
P¯S=Q
a∈¯SPa. This means that we have for example P¯4=P123. For the subsets S⊆4, we also use the following
notation

¯a,¯a∈ {123,124,134,234},

Va(qbx),AC4(x) =g¯a(x)
g¯a(qax). (4.4.10)

Reflection property Using the reflection property of the index in (2.4.6), we have
I[Pax] =q−1
aI[P∨
ax∨],I[Pabx] =I[P∨
abx∨],I[Pabcx] =I[P∨
abcx∨],I[P4x] =I[P∨
4x∨] (4.4.13)
for generic x. In terms of the structure functions, these are written as
Va(x) =qaVa(q−1
ax−1)−1,Sab(x) =Sab(q−1
aq−1
bx−1)
g¯a(x) =g¯a(qax−1)−1,AC4(x) =AC4(x−1).(4.4.14)
The properties (4.4.13) can be generalized as follows. Let X=P
i∈Ixiwhere Iis a finite set ( |I|<∞). Then,
I[PaX] =q−|I|
aI[P∨
aX∨],I[PabX] =I[P∨
abX∨],
I[PabcX] =I[P∨
abcX∨],I[P4X] =I[P∨
4X∨].(4.4.15)
Sign rules The reflection properties mentioned above are true only when the roots {xi}are generic. When {xi}is
not generic, the reflection property will give give extra sign factors. For example, let us consider the character P123x.
When xis generic, we simply have
I[P123x] =I[P∨
123x−1] (4.4.16)
However, when x→1, the character will contain a 1term which give zeros after taking the index. Therefore, the
reflection property should be modified as
I[P123−1] = (−1)I[P∨
123−1]. (4.4.17)
This is nothing special and actually related with the residue property introduced in Prop. 2.4.4.
Proposition 4.4.1. LetX=P
i∈Ixibe a character, where Iis a finite set and {xi}i∈Iare generic. Then, the
reflection property is
I[P123X] =I[P∨
123X∨]. (4.4.18)
Suppose that for example when {xi}are specialized and the character P123Xis decomposed as
P123X=Y+X
i∈I+1−X
i∈I−1(4.4.19)
where Ydoes not contain any ±1term and I±are finite sets giving ±1terms. Namely,
Y= [P123X](̸=0),X
i∈I+1−X
i∈I−1 = [P123X](0).(4.4.20)
The reflection property is then given as
I[P123X− |I+|+|I−|] = (−1)|I+|−|I−|I[P∨
123X∨− |I+|+|I−|]. (4.4.21)
Namely, the sign factor is determined by the unmovable terms (or the number of unmovable terms). Similar formulas
can be obtained for others: PaX,PAX,P4X.
Proposition 4.4.2. LetA,Bbe a character where A+B∨is movable. Then
I[A+B∨] = (−1)rk([B](̸=0))det[B](̸=0)I[A+B] (4.4.22)
Proof. Let[B](0)=m∈Z. Since A+B∨is movable, using A= [A](0)+ [A](̸=0), we have [A](0)=−m. We
then have
A+B∨= [A](̸=0)+ [B](̸=0)∨. (4.4.23)
Since both terms are movable, we can safely use the reflection property and obtain the statement.

As shown in Thm. 4.3.1, the poles are classified with solid partitions:
⃗ v= (vα)α=1,...,n, ⃗ ρ = (ρ(α))α=1,...,n,|ρ|=nX
α=1|ρ(α)|=k,

and at the fixed point ⃗ ρ, the character Kwill be
K|⃗ ρ=nX
α=1X
∈ρ(α)χ4,vα(). (4.4.29)
Since in our setup, a D8-brane will appear with a D8as a pair, it is natural to use the following notation
¯vα=Kαvα, α = 1, . . . , n, N=nX
α=1(1−Kα)vα (4.4.30)
where Kαphysically represents the distance between the D 8αandD8αbranes. Inserting this to (4.4.27) and taking
the index, we obtain

However, actually this is notcorrect. One reason for this is that obviously the character (4.4.26) is not quadrality

These extra sign factors need to be incorporated to get the quadrality invariant partition function.
Theorem 4.4.3 ([Nek17d, NP18]) .The total instanton partition function of the U(n|n)magnificent four system is
given by summation over n-tuple solid partitions,

CHAPTER 4. GAUGE ORIGAMI PARTITION FUNCTIONS 80
After evaluating the poles and inserting (4.4.29) to the character, the square root part needs to be movable (see
Def. 2.4.1) so that we can safely take the index. Moreover, for the magnificent four case, the choice of this square root
part is crucial and the sign rules depend on this choice. For example, we can also use
p
P4K∨K=P123K∨K (4.4.43)
for the square root part and the sign rule is modified to
σ4(ρ) = #{(x1, x2, x3, x4)∈ρ|x1=x2=x3≤x4}. (4.4.44)
Actually, this is the original choice of the square root part in [Nek17d, NP18].

Movability Let us study the movability of the character vD8
inst.explicitly for the U(1|1)partition function.
Theorem 4.4.6. The character vD8
inst.is movable.
Proof. It is enough to check the movability of vD8

JK residue and sign rules As mentioned before, with proper sign rules, the partition function is unique.
Theorem 4.4.7 ([Nek17d, NP18, Mon22]) .The magnificent four partition function does not depend on the choice of
the square root part:
(−1)σa(ρ)ZD8
4;a[ρ;K] = (−1)σb(ρ)ZD8
4;b[ρ;K]. (4.4.54)

Similar to the proof in Thm. 4.4.6, decompose K˜ρinto parts K˜ρ=Kρ′+Kρ′′and˜ρ=ρ′⊔ρ′′. Similar to the proof

Therefore, we have σ4(˜ρ) =σ4(ρ) +Pµ4−1
l=1δµ1,µ2,µ3,landσ3(˜ρ) =σ3(ρ) +Pµ3−1
k=1δµ1,µ2,k,µ 4which gives the
claim.
Since the partition function does not depend on the choice a∈4, from now on, we will choose a= 4 and
frequently use the sign factor σ4(ρ)when necessary. The sign rule can be derived by comparing the result from the
JK-residue and the index computation.
Theorem 4.4.8. The JK-residue of the integrand obeys the identity:
Gk×Res
x=xρx−1ZD8-D0
k (v, Kv, x I) = (−1)σa(ρ)ZD8
4;a[ρ, K]. (4.4.66)
The residue of the left-hand side is understood as (4.3.39):
Res
x=xρx−1ZD8-D0
k (v, Kv, x I) =Res
xkx−1
kRes
xk−1x−1
k−1···Res
x1=vx−1
1ZD8-D0
k (v, Kv, x I) (4.4.67)
and it is taken around poles in an ordering defined in (4.3.18). The extra sign factors of the right hand side comes from
the property discussed in Prop. 2.4.5. Let us check low levels and explicitly see where the extra signs appear after
evaluating the residue.
For|ρ|= 1, we only have one configuration ρ={v}where we identified the q-coordinates and the box position.
The residue is given as
G×Res
x=vx−1ZD8-D0
1 (v, Kv, x ) =G×Res
x=vx−1(1−Kv/x )
(1−v/x)=G(1−K)
I[−(1−K−1) +P∨
123] =G(1−K),(4.4.68)
and this is compatible with the fact that σ4(ρ) = 0 .
A nontrivial example is when |ρ|= 2andρ={v, q4v}. The residue is computed as

After computing the character and taking the index, one will obtain

x1=vx−1
1ZD8-D0
1 (v, Kv, x 1,2) =−ZD8
4;4[{v, q4v};K] (4.4.70)
and an extra sign factor appears. This is compatible with
σ4({v, q4v}) = #{(i, j, k, l )∈ρ|i=j=k < l}= #{(1,1,1,2)}= 1. (4.4.71)
Let us take a look more careful at how the residue is taken to see the origin of the sign factor. The first residue
comes from the pole at the (1−v/x1)in the denominator and thus Res
x1=vx−1
1(1−v/x1)−1= +1 . After inserting
x1=v, the integrand is a function of x2which takes the form as
Res
x1=vx−1
1(1−Kv/x 1)
(1−v/x1)g¯4x1
x2−1
g¯4x2
x1−1
=··· ×1
(1−q−1
4v/x2)(1−q−1
4x2/v)(4.4.72)
and thus when taking the residue at x2=q4v, we have Res
x2=q4vx−1
2(1−x2/q4v)−1=−1which gives an extra sign
factor. Note that to relate with the index using P∨
123, we rewrote AC4(x1/x2)−1=g¯4(x1/x2)−1g¯4(x2/x1)−1.
For higher instantons, the discussion is generalized as follows. Let x∗
1, . . . , x∗
kbe an ordering (4.3.18) and each
pole correspond to the q-coordinates of the boxes included in the solid partition.17The residue is then computed as
Res
xk=x∗

xk−1=x∗
k−1x−1
k−1··· Res
x1=x∗
1=vx−1
1ZD8-D0
k (v, Kv, {xI}).(4.4.73)
By definition, when taking the pole at xI=x∗
I, the function only depends on the variables xJ(J≥I):
Res
xI−1=x∗
I−1x−1
I−1··· Res
x1=x∗

k (v, Kv, {xI}) =···Y
J<Ig¯4x∗
J
xI−1
g¯4xI

J−1
. (4.4.74)
When taking the residue at xI=x∗
I, Prop. 2.4.5 tells us that if the pole xI=x∗
Icomes from the term g¯4(x∗
J/xI)−1
then the residue gives a +1sign, while if it comes from g¯4(xI/x∗
J)−1, we get a −1sign. By doing this procedure
recursively, one can obtain the sign factor σ4(ρ)for a given solid partition ρand its corresponding sequence of poles
{x∗
i}k
i=1. See [NP18, Sec. 2.4.2] for the original proof showing that the sign factor is really given by the formula in
(4.4.39). For completeness, the proof is reproduced in Appendix E.1.1 in our notation.
Plethystic exponential formula Another important property of the rank nmagnificent four partition function is that
the partition function does not depend on the Coulomb branch parameters18v1, . . . , v nbut only the productQ
αKα
[AK09, Nek17d, Nek09, PYZ23, FM23].

17Note that x∗
1=vbecause it is the origin of the solid partition.
18For the moment, there is no mathematical proof for this statement yet but we still call it a theorem, a physical theorem.

CHAPTER 4. GAUGE ORIGAMI PARTITION FUNCTIONS 84
An interesting property of this relation is that the factor inside the PE operator is completely decomposed into parts
depending on the equivariant parameters {q1,2,3,4}and the part depending on K,q. Note also that the coefficient factor
not depending on K,qis actually G.
One can show the above identity (4.4.75) for low levels explicitly. Let us focus first on the n= 1 case and the
one-instanton level:
ZD8
inst.[q, K;q1,2,3,4] = PE"

i=1(1−q−1

(1−q1)(1−q2)(1−q3)(1−q123)q+O 
q2(4.4.78)
where in the second line, we expanded the PE formula with respect to the powers of q. Obviously, this matches with
the one-instanton contribution in (4.4.68). After studying the higher instanton contributions, one will see that the extra
sign factors given in (4.4.39) is crucial when using the equivariant index formalism to get this identity.
Let us move on to the higher rank case. The Coulomb branch parameter independence of the rank two magnificent
four partition function can be confirmed at the one-instanton level as follows. The following two terms contribute:
ZD8
4;4[(v1, v2),(,∅); (K1, K2)] =G ×(1−K1)(1−K2v2/v1)
1−v2/v1,
ZD8
4;4[(v1, v2),(∅,); (K1, K2)] =G ×(1−K2)(1−K1v1/v2)
1−v1/v2(4.4.79)
and we have
ZD8
4;4[(v1, v2),(,∅); (K1, K2)] +ZD8
4;4[(v1, v2),(∅,); (K1, K2)] =G ×(1−K1K2), (4.4.80)
which indeed is independent of the Coulomb branch parameters. Another observation is that, comparing with (4.4.68),
the parameter Kis effectively modified to K1K2.
Assuming that the U(1|1)partition function obeys (4.4.77) and the Coulomb branch parameter independence of
the partition function, we can derive the rank nPE formula (4.4.75). The expanded version of the rank npartition
function is

which gives (4.4.75).
Specialization of PE formulas When we tune the parameters Kαto special values, the rank nmagnificent four
partition simplifies. Using Thm. 4.4.9, the rank npartition function with variables {Kα}is equivalent to the rank one
partition function with K=Q
αKα. Thus, it is enough to focus on the rank one magnificent four partition function.
The PE formula (4.4.77) shows that when we set K= 1, the partition function vanishes:
ZD8
inst.[q,1;q1,2,3,4] = 1. (4.4.87)
Physically, this means that when we set the distance between the D8 and D8 branes to be zero, which corresponds to
K= 1, the partition function vanishes. This property resembles the fact that when we place a pair of D-brane and
ghost ( not anti ) D-brane located at the same position, the system is equivalent to the closed string vacuum [OT06]
(see [Vaf01, DHJV16, KP19a, Kim23] for related references). On the other hand, when we tune the parameter as
K=qa(a∈4), the system actually reduces to a D0-D6 system with a D6-brane wrapping C3
¯a(see section 4.4.3).
Moreover, if we choose K=qN1
1qN2
2qN3
3qN4
4, we will get a tetrahedron instanton system with NaD6¯a-branes. Note
that due to the condition q1q2q3q4= 1, the tetrahedron system with N1=N2=N3=N4is also expected to be
equivalent to the string vacuum. This mechanism was conjectured in [Nek17d, NP18] (see also [PYZ23]) to be due
to the tachyon condensation of the D8 and D8 branes. Combining with the previous result, the magnificent four setup
seems to contain both properties of the ghost D-brane and anti D-brane. The complete mechanism happening here is
still not so clear and is left for future work.
Removing D8-branes Instead of keeping Kto be finite variables, one would like to ask if we can take the limit
K→0,∞. Since the parameter Kphysically is the (exponentiated) distance between the D8 and D8 branes, this
limit corresponds to removing the D8-brane from the system. Generally, such kind of limit might introduce Chern–
Simons terms to the system.
Let us first consider the rank one case and take the limit K→0. Namely, we are interested in the system coming
from the contour integral Prop. 4.2.1. The pole structure in Thm. 4.3.1 does not change and the sign rule (4.4.39) is
still true. In this case, no additional Chern–Simons term appears and the partition function is given as

Note that this result can be also obtained by simply setting K= 0in (4.4.68).
The partition function of the nD8-branes setup is given by

ZD8
4;4[(v1, v2),(,∅)] +ZD8
4;4[(v1, v2),(∅,)] =G,(4.4.92)
which is independent from v1, v2. Generally, one can show that the partition function of the nD8-branes setup has the
following PE formula

We have confirmed this equality at low instanton levels for various cases.19A different way to obtain this relation is to
simply set Kα= 0 in (4.4.75) and the proof of Thm. 4.4.9. This formula is surprising because it means that without
theD8-branes, no matter how many D8-branes we place, we effectively get the contribution of only one D8-brane.
We leave the physical explanation of this phenomenon for future work.

CHAPTER 4. GAUGE ORIGAMI PARTITION FUNCTIONS 88
Remark 4.4.12 .Compared with the contour integral formula, the equivariant index formalism is rather complicated.
The proper square root depends on which non-compact subspaces the D6-branes are spanning. For example, the U(1)
part of the 7d theory comes from eZD6
¯4[π]whose collision term comes from P∨
123which corresponds to the fact that it
is a theory on the subspace C3
123×S1. Generally, one may use a different square root choice but then one needs to
introduce the correct sign factors. It was mathematically proven that the above choice does not give any sign factor
in [FM23]. Later we will also see this property from the quantum algebraic view point.
One-loop perturbative part Similar to the magnificent four system, we can define the one-loop perturbative part as
˚v=X
(b,β)>(a,α)P∨
aPb
P4v¯b,β/v¯a,α (4.4.107)
where we specified an order in the pair of indices (¯a, α)α=1,...,n ¯a
a∈4 . Taking the index gives

JK residue and sign rules Similar to the D8 setup, let us relate the JK residue result and the partition function
computed by the index formalism. Focusing on the 7d U(1) theory on C3
¯a×S1, we have the following identification.
Theorem 4.4.13. The JK residue of the D6–D0 integrand obeys
Gk×Res
x=xπx−1ZD6-D0
¯a,k (v, xI) =eZD6
¯a[π], π∈ PP a (4.4.109)
where
ZD6-D0
¯a,k (v, xI) =Vav
xIY
I<JAC4xI
xJ−1
. (4.4.110)
A direct proof can be obtained similar to the D8 case but we omit it (see [KN24, Lemma B.1] for example). Instead
of directly proving this, we take a shortcut and obtain the above identity. First of all, let us set a= 4. The D6 ¯4–D0
integrand is obtained by starting from a rank one magnificent four setup and setting K=q4. Under this identification,
the solid partition will terminate its growth in the 4th direction and the poles will be classified by plane partitions.
With this restriction, from Thm. 4.4.8, we have
Gk×Res
x=xπx−1ZD6-D0
¯4,k(v, xI) = (−1)σ4(π)ZD8
4;4[π, q4] (4.4.111)
where we embedded the plane partition into the solid partition. We then have
ZD8
4;4[π, q4] =eZD6
¯4[π]. (4.4.112)
The sign factor is determined as
σ4(π) = #{(x1, x2, x3, x4)∈π|x1=x2=x3< x4}= #{(i, i, i, 1)∈i <1}= 0 (4.4.113)
because the plane partition πdoes not extend into the 4th direction. We can do the same discussion for other a∈4by
using Thm. 4.4.7 and the quadrality symmetry and obtain
Gk×Res
x=xπx−1ZD6-D0
¯a,k (v, xI) = (−1)σa(π)ZD8
4;a[π, qa] =eZD6
¯a[π], π∈ PP a. (4.4.114)
Using the same discussion, we can also get a different relation between the JK residue result and the equivariant
index result:
Gk×Res
x=xπx−1ZD6-D0
¯4,k(v, xI) = (−1)σb(π)ZD8
4;b[π, qb], b= 1,2,3 (4.4.115)

where π∈ PP 4. The right hand side is the partition function obtained by using a different square root part such as
P∨
234for the theory on C3
¯4×S1. However, the above equation says that one needs to introduce a proper sign factor.
Note that the sign rule can be rewritten as
σa(π) = #{(x1, x2, x3, x4)∈π|xb=xc=x4< xa}
= #{xb=xc= 1< xa}(4.4.116)
fora= 1,2,3. Moreover, it is related to the height of the plane partition in the a-th direction as
σa(π) = min {ha(π)−1,0}, h a(π):= min {xa≥1|(xa, xb, xc) = (xa,1,1)/∈π}. (4.4.117)
Summarizing the above discussion, we also have the following identification.
Corollary 4.4.14. After specializing K=qa(a∈4), we have the following identity:
(−1)σ4(π)ZD8
4;4[π, qa] =eZD6
¯a[π], a∈4 (4.4.118)
where π∈ PP a.
Plethystic exponential formula Similar to the magnificent four partition function, it is known that the tetrahedron
instanton partition functions do not depend on the Coulomb branch parameters. Since the D6-brane setup can be
obtained by tuning the parameters Kαof the magnificent four partition functions, Thm. 4.4.9 gives the following.
Theorem 4.4.15. The tetrahedron instanton partition function of n¯aD6-branes wrapping C3
¯a×S1does not depend on
the Coulomb branch parameters and we have

(1−q1)(1−q2)(1−q3)(4.4.121)
which matches with the PE formula.
Assuming that the PE formulas for the U(1) theories are (4.4.120) and that the partition function do not depend on
the Coulomb branch parameters, one can get the general case (Thm. 4.4.15) by doing the same procedure done in the
previous section. Since it is straightforward, we omit the discussion.
Let us study the case when there is one D6 ¯4-brane and discuss its physical interpretation. The perturbative part
can be computed as

where (0,0,0,1)denotes the number of D6-branes ⃗ n= (n1, n2, n3, n4). See the physical derivation of this perturba-

eq1,2,3=q1,2,3,eq4=q−1,eq5=q4q (4.4.124)
which obeys
eq1eq2eq3eq4eq5= 1. (4.4.125)
The perturbative and instanton parts are then rewritten as
Fpert.
(0,0,0,1)(eq1,2,3,4,5) =−(1−eq123)
(1−eq1)(1−eq2)(1−eq3),Finst.
(0,0,0,1)(eq1,2,3,4,5) =eq45(1−eq12)(1−eq13)(1−eq23)Q5
i=1(1−eqi).
(4.4.126)
Using (4.4.125), the sum is computed as
Fpert.
(0,0,0,1)+Finst.

i=1eqiQ5
i=1(1−eqi)+P5

i=1(1−eq−1
i). (4.4.127)
Actually, the right hand side of this equation coincides with the supergravity index of M-theory [Nek09, NO14,
PYZ23].
Relation with supergravity index Let us introduce the M-theory index on a non-compact toric Calabi–Yau 5-fold
X. We follow the discussion of [PYZ23, Sec. 5] (see also [HLS08, Nek09, NO14, DZNPZ21]). M-theory preserves an
11-dimensional Majorana spinor with 32 real components. When we take the background space-time to be S1×X, two
supercharges remain and the effective field theory on S1is just a 1d N= 2 SQM. Note that since Xis noncompact,
we neglected the gravitational effects. The U(1)5isometries of Xplay the roles of the global symmetries of this SQM.
Among them, four linearly independent combinations of the Cartan generators of this global symmetry commutes with
the supercharge.21Similar to what we did in section 4.1, we introduce flavor fugacities eqiand define the index as
ZX(eq1,eq2,eq3,eq4,eq5) =Tr(−1)Fe−βH5Y
i=1eqTi
i,5Y
i=1eqi= 1, (4.4.128)
where Fis the fermion number operator, βis the circumference of S1, and Tiare the Cartan generators of the global
symmetries. Nekrasov–Okounkov gave a simple expression for ZX:
ZX(eq1,2,3,4,5) = PE [ FX(eq1,2,3,4,5)] (4.4.129)
where
FX(eq1,2,3,4,5) =Z
Xch(T∗X ⊖TX)∧td(TX). (4.4.130)
ForX=C5, we have
ch(TC5) =5X
i=1eqi=5X
i=1e˜ϵi,td(TC5) =5Y
i=1˜ϵi
1−e−˜ϵi(4.4.131)
which reproduces the previous formula (4.4.127). A different way to derive this index was also performed in the
context of twisted supergravity [RSW21].
The agreement of the two partition functions is understood as follows. Consider nD6¯4-branes wrapping C3
¯4×S1
and D0-branes wrapping S1in type IIA string theory. This setup is realized in M-theory by considering the geometry
21This is similar to the story in C4gauge origami, where we introduced q1,2,3,4with the condition q1q2q3q4= 1.

R≃C4×R×S1
R
at the infinity, where S1
Ris the eleventh-dimensional direction and Ris the radius of it. In the limit R→ ∞ ,TNn
becomes ^C2/Zn. Since both setups are related with string duality, it is natural to expect
Fpert.
(0,0,0,n)+Finst.
(0,0,0,n)=FC3×^C2/Zn. (4.4.132)
Forn= 1, this is just the equality given above. For discussion on general n, see [Nek09, NO14]. For the case of the
tetrahedron instanton setup, namely for general ⃗ n, the resulting Xis conjectured to be obtained by superpositions of
the Taub-NUT spaces (see [PYZ23]).
Limits of PE formulas and MacMahon functions There are various limits when the PE formula in (4.4.120)
simplifies and connections with generating functions of plane partitions become much clearer. In this section, we will
study three different limits and also briefly discuss application to physics. The three limits are the unrefined limit,
refined limit, Macdonald refined limit.
•Unrefined limit : The unrefined limit is obtained by taking the limit q4→1. Under this limit, the PE formula
transforms as
ZD6
¯4[q]q4→1− − − → PEq
(1−q)2
. (4.4.133)
On the other hand, the expanded version of the instanton partition function transforms as
ZD6
inst.=X
π∈PPq|π|eZD6
¯4[π]q4→1− − − →X
π∈PPq|π|(4.4.134)
because all of the instanton contribution trivializes under this limit. We then have the following identity
M3d(q):= PEq
(1−q)2
=∞Y
n=11
(1−qn)n=X
πq|π|. (4.4.135)
This is the famous MacMahon formula giving the closed formula for the generating function of plane partitions
andM3d(q)is usually called the MacMahon function. This formula itself can be proved by the free fermions,
vertex operators and the relation with Schur functions [ORV03]. One may generalize the situation and con-
sider the generating function of plane partitions with nontrivial asymptotic Young diagrams. In such cases, the
generating function will be related with the so-called unrefined topological vertex [INOV03, AKMV03].
Compared to the MacMahon’s formula, the original D6 partition is a generating function of plane partitions with
nontrivial weights determined by q1,2,3,4. The unrefined limit is a simplification that makes all this nontrivial
weights trivial. Such kind of limit does not exist in the magnificent four case because a naive qa→1limit
makes the PE formula diverge.
•Refined limit : Another intuitive limit is the refined limit. We first rescale the equivariant parameters as
(q1, q2, q3, q4)7→(zr1q1, zr2q2, zr3q3, q4) (4.4.136)
where
r1+r2+r3= 0, r 1≫r3>0≫r2 (4.4.137)
and then take the limit z→0. Under this limit, we have
−q4(1−z−r3q12)(1−z−r2q13)(1−z−r1q23)
(1−zr1q1)(1−zr2q2)(1−zr3q3)z→0− − − → − q4(−z−r3q12)(−z−r1q23)
(−zr2q2)= 1. (4.4.138)
We then obtain
ZD6
¯4[q]→PEq
(1−q)(1−q4q)
= PEq
(1−q)(1−t)
=:M3d(q,t) (4.4.139)

# ページ 92

CHAPTER 4. GAUGE ORIGAMI PARTITION FUNCTIONS 92
where we defined t=q4q. The function M3d(t,q)is called the refined MacMahon function and it has an
expanded formula as
M3d(t,q) =X
πtP∞
i=1|π(−i)|qP∞
j=1|π(j−1)|=X
πq|π|qP∞
i=1|π(−i)|
4 (4.4.140)
where π(i) (i∈Z)is a diagonal slice of the plane partition πatx2+x1=i. This formula also can be
proved by the transfer matrix method and it is related with Schur functions and Macdonald symmetric functions.
Generalization to plane partitions with nontrivial asymptotic Young diagrams can be done and it will be related
with the refined topological vertex [IKV07, AK08, Tak07, NO14].
Similar to the previous case, one can also show that under this limit, we have
q|π|eZD6
¯4[π]→tP∞
i=1|π(−i)|qP∞
j=1|π(j−1)|. (4.4.141)
We will not show this explicitly in this thesis, but one can implement all the formulas in a computer program
and check it for lower levels.
•Macdonald refined limit : A different limit is the Macdonald refined limit
(q1, q2, q3, q4)7→(zrq1, z−rq2, q3, q4) (4.4.142)
withz→0. Under this limit, we have
−q4(1−q−1
34)(1−zrq13)(1−z−rq23)
(1−zrq1)(1−z−rq2)(1−q3)z→0− − − → − q4(1−q−1
34)(−z−rq23)
(1−q3)(−z−rq2)=(1−q34)
(1−q3)(4.4.143)
which gives
ZD6
¯4[q]→PE1−q34
1−q3q
(1−q)(1−q4q)
. (4.4.144)
This Macdonald refined limit has not been studied much compared with the previous two limits. Actualy, the
PE formula above is related with the one given in [FW17, Eq. (1.7)–(1.8)]
PE1−t
1−qx
(1−x)(1−y)
(4.4.145)
after the specialization x=q, y=q4q, q=q3, t=q34. Historically, Vuleti ´c introduced a two parameter
generalization of MacMahon’s formula taking the form as
X
πFπ(q, t)x|π|= PE1−t
1−qx
(1−x)2
=∞Y
i,n+1=11−xiqnt
1−xiqni
(4.4.146)
where the explicit formula for Fπ(q, t)is in [Vul07, Eq. (1.4)]. Since the right hand side is directly related
with the Macdonald kernel function, it is called the Macdonald refinement of MacMahon’s function. Later,
Cai–Wang–Wu–Yang studied the associated vertex operators in [CWWY15], and Foda–Wu introduced another
refinement x, yto it, taking the form as
X
πFπ(q, t)xP∞
j=1|π(j−1)|yP∞
i=1|π(−i)|= PE1−t
1−qx
(1−x)(1−y)
, (4.4.147)
and discussed applications to supersymmetric gauge theories and topological string theory in [FW17] (see also
[FM18]). The difference between the limit of the D6 partition function and Foda–Wu’s formula is that while
we only have three independent deformation parameters q3, q4,qhere, theirs have four independent deformation
parameters x, y, q, t . In this sense, the PE formula obtained from the D6 partition function is some specialization
of their setup. We abuse the terminology and still call this limit the Macdonald refined limit . The explicit
correspondence
q|π|eZD6
¯4[π]−→Fπ(q, t)xP∞
j=1|π(j−1)|yP∞
i=1|π(−i)|
x=q, y=q4q, q=q3, t=q34(4.4.148)
is rather difficult to show generally but one can implement everything in a computer program and explicitly
check that they indeed correspond with each other.

Free field realizations and vertex operators
In this chapter, we introduce vertex operators whose vacuum expectation value reproduces the contour integral formula
of the Witten index of a low energy field theory. In section 5.1, we introduce the concept of q-deformed quiver Cartan
matrices (shortly qquiver Cartan matrix) and give a definition of them. Using this qquiver Cartan matrix, we introduce
vertex operators using free bosons and derive the free field realization of the Witten index. In section 5.2, we apply this
formalism to each gauge origami setup and show that they indeed reproduce the contour integral formula after taking
the vacuum expectation value. These free field realizations imply the existence of an underlying quantum algebraic
structure which will be discussed in Chap. 6. This chapter is mainly based on [KN23].
5.1 Vertex operators and quivers
As discussed in section 4.2, the Witten index of an N= 2 supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanical system
(4.2.9) is written as a contour integral over rational functions coming from the vector, chiral, and Fermi superfield
contributions. Given a quiver Q= (Q0,Q1), we define a q-deformed Cartan matrix encoding the flavor charges of
the component fields and show that the contour integral formula has a free field realization in vertex operators. The
basic components are rewritten in the multiplicative variables as follows.
• For each gauge group (circle node) of the theory, we have

For explicit construction of the free field realization, let us introduce the halfq-deformed quiver Cartan matrix .22
We shortly call this the half qquiver23Cartan matrix.
22In the context of quiver W-algebras, a similar q-Cartan matrix appears (see for example [Kim20, Sec.2.2.3]). The quiver considered there is a
4 SUSY quiver while the one here is a 2 SUSY quiver.

CHAPTER 5. FREE FIELD REALIZATIONS AND VERTEX OPERATORS 98
Definition 5.1.1. LetQ= (Q0,Q1)be a 2 SUSY quiver. We assume that the flavor charges are associated with
the chiral and Fermi superfields as mentioned in section 4.1. Namely, for each chiral superfield Φa→band Fermi
superfield Λa→b, we associate the flavor charges q(Φa→b)andq(Λa→b)respectively. The (positive) half qquiver
Cartan matrix c+= (c+
ab)a,b∈Q0is defined as follows. For circle nodes a, b∈Q0, it is defined as
c+
ab=δab−X
b→aq(Φb→a) +X
b→aq(Λb→a),(5.1.4)
where the sum is taken over all arrows connecting the two quiver nodes.
The first term is understood as the contribution from the vector superfield. Note that when one of the nodes is
a square node, the first term of the half qquiver Cartan matrix disappears. We omit the discussion when both nodes
are square nodes. Such contributions are decoupled from the supersymmetric quantum mechanical system at the low
energy limit.24
Definition 5.1.2. Given the (positive) half qquiver Cartan matrix c+= (c+
ab)a,b∈Q0, we define the Hermitian conjugate
(conjugate transpose)25operation of it as
(c+†)ab=c+∨
ba(5.1.5)
where the dual operation ∨simply changes the flavor charges to the inverse (which follows the convention in (2.4.5)).
We sometimes call this the negative half qquiver Cartan matrix and denote it as c−
ab=c+∨
ba.
Definition 5.1.3. The degree n∈Zhalf qquiver Cartan matrix is defined by taking the n-th Adams operation:
c+[n]
ab=δab−X
b→aq(Φb→a)n+X
b→aq(Λb→a)n(5.1.6)
where the convention [n]comes from (2.4.7).
Given the above ingredients, we define the total qquiver Cartan matrix.
Definition 5.1.4. Thetotal qquiver Cartan matrix c= (cab)a,b∈Q0is defined as the sum of positive and negative
half qquiver Cartan matrices:
cab=c+
ab+c−
ab= 2δab− X
b→aq(Φb→a) +X
a→bq(Φa→b)−1!
+ X
b→aq(Λb→a) +X
a→bq(Λa→b)−1!
.(5.1.7)
We sometimes omit the total and simply call it the qquiver Cartan matrix.
An important property of this total qquiver Cartan matrix is that it is self-adjoint ( Hermitian ):
c†
ab=cab. (5.1.8)
Then-th Adams operation is induced similarly as discussed above. The strategy to find free field realizations is then
given as follows.
1. For each quiver node a∈Q0, we associate a vertex operator assuming the form
Va(x) =va,0(x) exp
X
n̸=0
n∈Zva,nx−n
, (5.1.9)
where va,0(x)is the zero-mode of the vertex operator.
24In instanton contributions, they appear as one–loop perturbative contributions.
25Since we are taking the transpose and the dual operation which resembles the Hermitian conjugate operation †, we abuse the terminology and
call it in such way. The symbol †also comes from this motivation.

# ページ 99

99 CHAPTER 5. FREE FIELD REALIZATIONS AND VERTEX OPERATORS
2. We impose the commutation relations of the non-zero modes {va,n}using the total qquiver Cartan matrix:
[va,n,vb,m] =−1
nδn+m,0c[n]
ab. (5.1.10)
In this thesis, we do not give a general description on how to determine the qquiver Cartan matrix when both
the nodes a, b∈Q0are square nodes (flavor nodes).
3. We further need to impose the commutation relations on the zero-modes va,0(x)but in this thesis we do not give
a systematic procedure to define it. Examples will be given in section 5.2.5.
4. Suppose that the rank of the quiver node a∈Q0isNa. The free field realization of the Witten index is then
given as
I
JKY
a∈Q0NaY
I=1dx(a)
I
2πix(a)
IY
a∈Q0NaY
I=1Va(x(a)
I). (5.1.11)
We assumed here for simplicity that all the quiver nodes are circle nodes. If some are square nodes, one will
simply discard the contour integral over the flavor fugacities.
Let us give some motivation of the above procedure. The operator product of the vertex operators Va(xI)andVb(xJ)
is given by
Va(xI)Vb(xJ) =va,0(xI)vb,0(xJ)exp X
n>0−1

a→b(1−q(Φa→b)−1xJ/xI)
×:Va(xI)Vb(xJ) :,
(5.1.12)
where the operator product of the zero-modes are denoted as
va,0(xI)vb,0(xJ) =va,0(xI)vb,0(xJ):va,0(xI)vb,0(xJ) :. (5.1.13)
After proper definitions of the zero-modes, we can reproduce the contributions (5.1.1), (5.1.2), and (5.1.3). We note
that when chiral and Fermi superfields transforming under the adjoint representation of a gauge group exist in the
theory considered, overall factors not depending on the fugacities x(a)
Iappear. Such factors are not reproduced from
the operator product of the vertex operators and we need to add them by hand.
Furthermore, when considering operator products, we need to specify the order of the operators because generally
they might not commute with each other. In this thesis, we simply assume that we can introduce proper zero-modes
so that the rational functions arising in the right hand side are the same after analytic continuation:
Va(xI)Vb(xJ) =Vb(xJ)Va(xI). (5.1.14)
Whether we can impose this condition and find an explicit expression generally is nontrivial and it will not be discussed
in this thesis.
When understanding the operator product in (5.1.11), we understand the products for vertex operators associated
with flavor nodes using normal products:
:Y
aNaY
I=1Va(v(a)
I) : (5.1.15)
where v(a)
Iare the flavor fugacities. In this way, we do not need the definition of the qquiver Cartan matrix associated
with two flavor nodes. Physically, we are simply discarding the contributions which are not needed when evaluating
the contour integral. In instanton counting, they will correspond to the one-loop perturbative factors.

CHAPTER 5. FREE FIELD REALIZATIONS AND VERTEX OPERATORS 100
5.2 Free field realizations of gauge origami
In Chap. 4, we derived the contour integral formulas and non-perturbative partition functions of the magnificent four
(4.4.24), tetrahedron instantons (4.4.94), spiked instantons (4.4.149). All of the formulas are derived from an N= 2
quiver. In this section, we will explicitly find the free field realizations of the contour integral formula for each setup
by following the general discussion of section 5.1.
The main statements of this section are summarized as follows.
Theorem 5.2.1. For each D-brane (D0, D2, D4, D6, D8), we can define the corresponding vertex operators as
D-brane space-time vertex operator reference
D0-brane S1A(x) (5.2.6), (5.2.7)
D2-brane Ca×S1(a∈4) Sa(x) (5.2.60)
D4-brane C2
A×S1(A∈6) XA(x) (5.2.47), (5.2.48)
D6-brane C3
¯a×S1(a∈4) W¯a(x) (5.2.29), (5.2.31)
D8-brane C4×S1Z(x) (5.2.10), (5.2.12)(5.2.1)
In the contour integral formula, the D0-branes giving instanton contributions arise from26A−1(x), while other D-branes
arise from Sa(x),XA(x),W¯a(x),Z(x). To include anti D-branes/negative D-branes, we need to reverse the power of
the operators as Sa(x)−1,XA(x)−1,W¯a(x)−1,Z(x)−1.
Theorem 5.2.2. The contour integral formula of the k-instanton sector of the partition function of the gauge origami
system takes the form as
Zk=Gk
k!I
JKkY
I=1dxI
2πιxI⟨0|kY
I=1A(xI)−1:Y
iVi(vi) :|0⟩, (5.2.2)
where Vi(x)is an operator written from {XA(x),W¯a(x),Z(x)}.
5.2.1 Magnificent four
Let us start with the magnificent four system. The vertex operator of this system was already introduced in [Kim22b]
in the context of double quiver gauge theory (see also [Kim19]). In this section, we derive the vertex operators that
reproduce the contour integral formula (4.4.24) by performing the procedure discussed in section 5.1 in a more explicit
way. We then discuss how to directly derive the vertex operators using the quiver structure (4.1.6) and the qquiver
Cartan matrix in Def. 5.1.4.
The goal of this section is to reproduce the rational function ZD8-D0(vα,¯vα, xI)given in (4.4.24). One can observe
that it factorizes in a nice way that rational functions only appear and the fundamental objects are
(1−¯vα/xI)
(1−vα/xI),AC4xI
xJ−1
. (5.2.3)
Let us first start from the AC4(x)−1part. Let A(x)be some operator whose operator product is given as
A(x)A(x′) =AC4x′
x−1
:A(x)A(x′) :, (5.2.4)
Under this ansatz, indeed the AC4(x)−1part is reproduced as follows:
A(xk)−1···A(x1)−1=Y
I<JAC4xI
xJ−1
:kY
I=1A(xI)−1:. (5.2.5)
26In this paper, when we write V(x)−1for a vertex operator V(x), we are meaning :V(x)−1:. The normal ordering of them is implicitly
imposed.

# ページ 101

101 CHAPTER 5. FREE FIELD REALIZATIONS AND VERTEX OPERATORS
Note here the inverse of the operator is understood as A−1(x) = : A−1(x) :. Taking the inverse here is just for
convention so that the result matches with results in the literature.
We then assume a free field realization which means that the operator A(x)is a vertex operator written using free
bosons:
A(x) =a0(x) : exp
X
n̸=0anx−n
:, (5.2.6)
where a0(x)is some zero-mode and anare the free bosons. So that we can reproduce (5.2.4), we need the commutation
relation
[an,am] =−1
nP[n]
4δn+m,0, (5.2.7)
and
a0(x)a0(x′)= 1 (5.2.8)
where we used the convention (5.1.13). For the zero modes a0(z), we further impose the condition that the OPE factor
will be the same rational function. Namely, using (4.4.14), we impose
a0(x)a0(x′)=a0(x′)a0(x) (5.2.9)
and then we have the OPE factor symmetric in xandx′. The derivation and explicit form of the zero modes are
discussed in section 5.2.5.
From the supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics view point, the parameters {xI}k
I=1are the exponent of the
Cartan subalgebra of U(k)which comes from the kD0-branes in the gauge origami setup. In this sense, the vertex
operator A(x)−1introduced here is associated with the D0-brane (see Chap. 3) and so we call it the D0-brane vertex
operator . In the algebraic context, it is called the root current because it is associated with the roots of the quiver
[FR97, FR98]. In the context of quiver W-algebra [KP15] and double quiver gauge theory [Kim22b], this is just the
root current of the affine quiver W-algebra which is denoted by the (bA0,bA0)theory in the terminology of [Kim22b].
Let us move on to reproducing the rational function part including vα,¯vα. To do this, we introduce a vertex
operator Z(x)
Z(x) =z0(x) : exp
X
n̸=0znx−n
: (5.2.10)
with the OPE relation
Z(x)A(x′) =z0(x)a0(x′)(1−x′/x) :Z(x)A(x′) :
A(x′)Z(x) =a0(x′)z0(x)(1−x/x′) :A(x′)Z(x) :.(5.2.11)
The commutation relations are then determined as
[an,zm] =−1
nδn+m,0,zn=an
P[n]
4(5.2.12)
which also gives
[zn,zm] =−1
n1
P[n]
4δn+m,0. (5.2.13)
Using this vertex operators, we then have
A−1(xI):nY
α=1Z(vα)
Z(¯vα): =nY
α=1a0(xI)z0(¯vα)
a0(xI)z0(vα)nY
α=1(1−¯vα/xI)
(1−vα/xI):A−1(xI)nY
α=1Z(vα)
Z(¯vα): (5.2.14)
which indeed reproduces the rational functions including parameters {vα,¯vα}. Similar to the previous discussion,
since Z(x)±1reproduces the contributions from the flavor nodes with fugacities {vα,¯vα}, we call it the D8-brane
vertex operator .

CHAPTER 5. FREE FIELD REALIZATIONS AND VERTEX OPERATORS 102
Since the magnificent four system we are interested in includes the same number of D8 and D8-branes (4.2.16), it
is convenient to introduce a vertex operator representing the coupled system with one set of D8 and D8 branes as (see
also (4.4.30)):
Z(K, x):= :Z(x)
Z(Kx): =˜zK
0(x) : exp
X
n̸=0˜zK
nx−n
:,˜zK
n= (1−K−n)zn=1−K−n
P[n]
4an, (5.2.15)
where K∈C×is a generic parameter. This parameter is the parameter introduced in (4.4.30) and corresponds to the
distance between the D8 and D8 branes physically. This gives
Z(K, x)A(x′) =ezK
0(x)a0(x′)1−x′/x
1−K−1x′/x:Z(K, x)A(x′) :,
A(x′)Z(K, x) =a0(x′)ezK
0(x)1−x/x′
1−Kx/x′:Z(K, x)A(x′) :(5.2.16)
For the zero modes, we impose that the contraction with the root current will be the same rational function after
analytic continuation:
˜zK
0(x)a0(x′)=K−1a0(x′)˜zK
0(x). (5.2.17)
We impose a0(x′)˜zK
0(x)= 1(see section 5.2.5). Note that we are relaxing the conditions and only imposing conditions
on the zero modes of the brane anti-brane coupled vertex operator eZKbut not the Z-operator itself.
Proposition 5.2.3. The contour integral formula of the magnificent four system shown in (4.4.24) has a free field
realization as
qkZD8
k=qkGk
k!I
JKkY
I=1dxI

(5.2.19)
and⟨O⟩=⟨0|O |0⟩.
Note that we need to determine an order in the operators when doing explicit computations. In most of the cases,
we simply assumeQk
I=1O(xI) =O(xk)···O (x2)O(x1)for an operator O(x). Actually, because of the zero modes
conditions (5.2.9) and (5.2.17), the order of the operators is not relevant after analytic continuation.
Quiver interpretation Let us rederive the commutation relations (5.2.7), (5.2.12) directly from the quiver diagram
(4.1.6) by using the general description proposed in section 5.1. Let us first focus on the AAcommutation relation
(5.2.7) coming from the adjoint superfields of U(k). Given the following quiver, we can define the positive half qquiver
Cartan matrix in Def. 5.1.1 as
k q2, q2q4 q1, q1q4
q3, q3q4 q4k q2, q2q4 q1, q1q4
q3, q3q4 q4k q2, q2q4 q1, q1q4

⇝c+
D0,D0= 1−(q1+q2+q3+q4) + (q14+q24+q34),(5.2.20)
where we represent the quiver node by D0 and only draw the subquiver related. The term 1corresponds to the vector
superfield, q1,2,3,4correspond to the chiral superfield, and q14,24,34correspond to the Fermi superfield contribution,
respectively.
We further define the negative half quiver Cartan matrix as

D8,D0=−1. (5.2.25)
We represented the quiver node with rank nas D8 because of its relation with the D8-brane. We then have
[−an,zm] =−1
nc[n]
D0,D8δn+m,0=1
nδn+m,0 (5.2.26)
which indeed reproduces (5.2.13). The extra sign −anappears here because we used A−1in the contour integral to
get the free field realization.
One–loop perturbative part Note also that the OPE of the Z(K, x)operators give the perturbative factor introduced
in (4.4.45):

5.2.2 Tetrahedron instanton
Let us find the free field realization of the contour integral formula given in (4.4.94). The contributions coming from
AC4(x)−1are the same with the D8-case and thus they are reproduced by the D0 vertex operator A(x). The different
part is
Vav¯a,α
xI
(5.2.28)
whose physical origin is the D6-branes in the setup. In this case, we have four types of D6-branes depending on which
complex three-planes C3
¯athey wrap. We introduce four types of D6-brane vertex operators defined as
W¯a(x) =w¯a,0(x) : exp
X
n̸=0w¯a,nx−n
:, a∈4 (5.2.29)
where w¯a,0(x)are zero modes. The operator product with respect to the D0-brane vertex operators are imposed as
A(x)W¯a(x′) =a0(x)w¯a,0(x′)Va(x′/x)−1:A(x)W¯a(x′) :
W¯a(x′)A(x) =w¯a,0(x′)a0(x)Va(q−1

Explicitly, we impose a0(x)w¯a,0(x′)= 1(see section 5.2.5). The free field realization of the contour integral formula
of the tetrahedron instanton system is then given as follows.
Proposition 5.2.4. The tetrahedron instanton partition function (4.4.94) is equivalent to the following vertex operator
correlation function after analytic continuation,
qkZD6
k=qkGk
k!I
JKkY
I=1dxI
2πixI⟨A−1
kWn⟩ (5.2.33)
where
Ak=kY
I=1A(xI),Wn= :Y
a∈4n¯aY
α=1W¯a(v¯a,α) :,⟨A−1
kWn⟩=Y
a∈4n¯aY
α=1kY
I=1Vav¯a,α
xIY
I<JAC4xI
xJ−1
.
(5.2.34a)
Note that the order of the operator product in Akdoes not change the result.
One–loop perturbativ part The OPE of the W-operators give the one loop perturbative part in (4.4.108):
W¯b(v¯b,β)W¯a(v¯a,α) =ZD6-D6
1-loop (v¯a,α,¯a|v¯b,β,¯b) :W¯b(v¯b,β)W¯a(v¯a,α) :. (5.2.35)
Quiver interpretation Let us rederive the commutation relation (5.2.31). Similar to the magnificent four case, this
can be explicitly read from the quiver (4.1.9). Due to quadrality, it is enough to focus on one of the stacks of D6-branes
which we take the D6 123-branes. The half qquiver Cartan matrices are given as
kn¯4
1q4
k⇝(
c+
D0,D6=−1 +q4,
c+
D6,D0= 0.(5.2.36)
which gives the qquiver Cartan matrix
cD0,D6=c+
D0,D6+c+∨
D6,D0=−1 +q4. (5.2.37)
We then have
[−an,w¯4,m] =−1
nc[n]
D0,D6δn+m,0=1
nP[n]
4δn+m,0 (5.2.38)
which indeed reproduces (5.2.31).
Relation with magnificent four Let us focus on the 7d U(1) theory on C3
¯a×S1. Starting from the 9d U(1|1)theory
of the magnificent four and tuning the parameter K=qa, we have
Z(qa, x) = :Z(x)
Z(qax):≃W¯a(x), (5.2.39)
where the equality ≃is up to extra zero modes depending on the explicit form. In our notation in section 5.2.5, this
becomes an exact identity. Generally, starting from a 9d U(n|n)magnificent four theory with parameters (Kα)n
α=1,
n=P
a∈4n¯aand tuning
(Kα)n
α=1−→(K¯a,α)n¯a
α=1, K ¯a,α=qa (5.2.40)

# ページ 105

105 CHAPTER 5. FREE FIELD REALIZATIONS AND VERTEX OPERATORS
we have
⟨A−1
keZK
n⟩=⟨A−1
kWn⟩, (5.2.41)
and thus, we obtain the tetrahedron instanton system. Note also that setting K=q−1
agives
Z(q−1
a, x) = :Z(x)
Z(q−1ax): =W¯a(q−1
ax)−1(5.2.42)
which allows W¯a(x)to appear in the denominator.
Physically, this property suggests that the D8-branes and anti-D8-branes annihilate in a specific distance under
theΩ-background and eventually reproduce the, generally intersecting, D6-branes system [Nek17d, NP18, PYZ21,
PYZ23], which is also interpreted as a tachyon condensation [Sen98].
Supergroup generalization Following the construction of the magnificent four system in (5.2.15), we can write
down the contour integral formula with D6 operators appearing in the denominator:
:W¯a(v1)···W¯a(vn)
W¯a(u1)···W¯a(um):. (5.2.43)
The contour integral formula is proportional to
IkY
I=1dxI
2πixI⟨A−1
kWn|m⟩ (5.2.44)
where
Ak=kY
I=1A(xI),Wn|m= :Y

. (5.2.45b)
We expect that the operators in the denominators of (5.2.43) correspond to D6-branes similar to the situation of the
magnificent four system. We leave a detailed analysis of the evaluation of this contour integral formula and its relation
with the 7d supergroup gauge theory for future work [JKN+24]. We will see in later sections, that after tuning the
parameters {u¯a,β}to special values, we can further reduce the system and obtain the contour integral formula of the
spiked instanton system.
5.2.3 Spiked instanton
Let us next consider the spiked instanton system where D4-branes wrapping C2
A×S1(A∈6)appear and find the free
field realization of (4.4.149). In this case, we need to deal with the rational function
S¯AvA,α
xI
. (5.2.46)
The derivation is similar to the previous cases and the D4-brane vertex operators are defined as
XA(x) =xA,0(x) : exp
X
n̸=0xA,nx−n
:,[xA,n,xB,m] =−1
nP[n]

P[−n]
AP[n]
Bδn+m,0, (5.2.47)
where xA,0(x)is the zero mode and the commutation relation with the A-operator is
xA,n=an
P[−n]
A, [an,xA,m] =−1
nP[n]
¯Aδn+m,0. (5.2.48)

CHAPTER 5. FREE FIELD REALIZATIONS AND VERTEX OPERATORS 106
Explicitly, the contraction formulas are
A(x)XA(ν) =S¯A(ν/x)−1a0(x)xA,0(x′):A(x)XA(ν) :,
XA(ν)A(x) =S¯A(qAx/ν)−1xA,0(x′)a0(x):XA(ν)A(x) :.(5.2.49)
We impose the following condition on the zero modes so that the operator product of the right-hand side is the same
rational function after analytic continuation (4.4.14):
a0(x)xA,0(x′)=xA,0(x′)a0(x). (5.2.50)
We will use a0(x)xA,0(x′)= 1(see section 5.2.5 for explicit forms).
Proposition 5.2.5. The free field realization of the contour integral formula (4.4.149) is
qkZD4
k=qkGk
k!I
JKkY
I=1dxI
2πixI⟨A−1
kXn⟩ (5.2.51)
where
Ak=kY
I=1A(xI),Xn= :Y
A∈6nAY
α=1XA(vA,α) :,⟨A−1
kXn⟩=Y

I=1nAY
α=1S¯AvA,α
xIY
I<JAC4xI
xJ−1
.
(5.2.52a)
The one-loop perturbative part in (4.4.162) is obtained by the OPE of the Xoperators:
XB(vB,β)XA(vA,α) =ZD4-D4
1-loop (vA,α, A|vB,β, B) :XB(vB,β)XA(vA,α) :. (5.2.53)
Quiver interpretation Let us rederive the commutation relation in (5.2.48) directly from the quiver in (4.1.12). Due
to quadrality, it is enough to focus on the D4 12-branes. The half qquiver Cartan matrices are determined as
kn12
1, q4 q12, q124=q−1
3
k⇝(
c+
D0,D4=−1 +q4,
c+
D4,D0=−q12+q−1
3(5.2.54)
which gives the qquiver Cartan matrix
cD0,D4=c+
D0,D4+c+∨
D4,D0=−(1 +q−1
12) + (q4+q3) =−(1−q3)(1−q4). (5.2.55)
We then obtain
[−an,x12,m] =−1
nδn+m,0c[n]
D0,D4=1
nP[n]
34δn+m,0 (5.2.56)
which indeed reproduces the commutation relation (5.2.48).
Relation with tetrahedron instanton Similar to the situation in (5.2.39), where the D8– D8 coupled system is
reduced to the tetrahedron system, using (5.2.43) and specializing the parameters, we can obtain the contour integral
formula of the spiked instanton system. This comes from the following relation:
Xab(x)≃:Wabc(x)
Wabc(qcx): (5.2.57)

# ページ 107

107 CHAPTER 5. FREE FIELD REALIZATIONS AND VERTEX OPERATORS
where ≃means they are equivalent up to zero modes. In our notation of the zero modes, it will become an exact
identity (see (5.2.78)). For example, we have
:n12Y
α=1X12(v12,α) : = :n12Y
α=1W123(v12,α)
W123(q3v12,α): (5.2.58)
which means by considering the D6– D6 system spanning C3
123×S1and tuning the positions of them with the parameter
q3, we can obtain the 5d theory on C2
12×S1.
5.2.4 D2-brane vertex operators
Given the D0-brane vertex operator, the non-zero modes of the D4 (5.2.47), D6 (5.2.29), and D8 (5.2.10) vertex
operators are written using anin a similar way:
an=P[−n]
SAn,An=xA,n,w¯a,n,zn (5.2.59)
where Sis a subset of 4depending on the subspace the D-branes are spanning. Explicitly, the D6 123-brane vertex
operator comes from P123. Therefore, it is natural to define a D2-brane vertex operator defined as
Sa(x) =sa,0(x) : exp
X
n̸=0sa,nx−n
:,[sa,n,sb,m] =−1
nP[n]
4
P[−n]
aP[n]
bδn+m,0, (5.2.60)
where sa,0(x)is the zero modes and the relation with the A-operator is
[an,sa,m] =−1
nP[n]
¯aδn+m,0,sa,n=an
P[−n]
a. (5.2.61)
The operator product formulas are
A(x)Sa(x′) =a0(x)sa,0(x′)g¯a(x′/x)−1:A(x)Sa(x′) :,
Sa(x′)A(x) =sa,0(x′)a0(x)g¯a(qax/x′) :A(x)Sa(x′) :,(5.2.62)
where we impose the zero modes condition as
a0(x)sa,0(x′)=sa,0(x′)a0(x). (5.2.63)
so that the rational function arising on the right-hand side will be the same after using (4.4.14). Explicitly, we have
a0(x)sa,0(x′)= 1(see section 5.2.5).
These D2-brane vertex operators are actually related to the screening currents of quiver W-algebras [KP15]. Let
us consider the two screening currents S1(x)andS2(x). Focusing on S2(x), we have
[s2,n,s2,m] =−1
n1−qn
1
1−q−n
2(1−qn
3)(1−qn
4)δn+m,0 (5.2.64)
which gives one of the screening currents of the affine quiver W-algebra [KP15, eq. (3.33)]. The screening current
S1(x)gives the other screening current. The other two screening currents S3(x),S4(x)are introduced in a symmetric
way using the quadrality. Thus, using two screening currents Sa(x),Sb(x′) (a̸=b)we will obtain six affine quiver
W-algebras.
5.2.5 Zero modes conditions
Let us impose some conditions on the zero modes a0(x),ezK
0(x),w¯a,0(x),xA,0(x),sa,0(x)and determine the free field
realizations of them. Using the observation (5.2.59), we can see that the operator product with operators associated
with D-branes intersecting only at a point will give rational functions. We impose the zero modes so that the operator
product will be the same rational functions after the analytic continuation. For the cases, when the A-operator is
involved, the conditions are given in (5.2.9), (5.2.17), (5.2.32), (5.2.50), (5.2.63). For the cases when the S-operators
are involved, we impose the following conditions:

CHAPTER 5. FREE FIELD REALIZATIONS AND VERTEX OPERATORS 108
• D2 a-D2b(a̸=b):
Sa(x)Sb(x′) =sa,0(x)sb,0(x′)Sab(qax′/x) :Sa(x)Sb(x′) :, (5.2.65a)
Sb(x′)Sa(x) =sb,0(x′)sa,0(x)Sab(qbx′/x) :Sa(x)Sb(x′) : (5.2.65b)
which gives the zero mode condition
sa,0(x)sb,0(x′)=sb,0(x′)sa,0(x), a̸=b. (5.2.66)
• D4 A-D2c(c, d∈¯A):
XA(x)Sc(x′) =xA,0(x)sc,0(x′)1−qAx′/x

Ax/x′
1−q−1
Aq−1
dx/x′:XA(x)Sc(x′) : (5.2.67b)
which gives the zero mode condition
xA,0(x)sc,0(x′)=q−1
Aq−1
csc,0(x′)xA,0(x). (5.2.68)
• D2 a-D6¯a:
W¯a(x)Sa(x′) =w¯a,0(x)sa,0(x′)1
1−q−1ax′/x:W¯a(x)Sa(x′) :, (5.2.69a)
Sa(x′)W¯a(x) =sa,0(x′)w¯a,0(x)1
1−qax/x′:W¯a(x)Sa(x′) : (5.2.69b)
which gives the zero mode condition
w¯a,0(x)sa,0(x′)=
−x′
qax
sa,0(x′)w¯a,0(x). (5.2.70)
We can do the same analysis for the D4-brane operators as
XA(x)X¯A(x′) =xA,0(x)x¯A,0(x′)
1−qAx′
x
:XA(x)X¯A(x′) :, (5.2.71a)

1−q¯Ax
x′
:XA(x)X¯A(x′) : (5.2.71b)
and impose the condition
xA,0(x)x¯A,0(x′) =
−q−1
Ax
x′
x¯A,0(x′)xA,0(x) (5.2.72)
but to make the discussion simple, we do not impose this condition.27
Under these conditions, the free field realizations of the zero modes are given as
a0(x) =ea0,sa,0(x) =xsa,0eesa,0,w¯a(x) =xw¯a,0eew¯a,0eeew¯a,0,
xA,0(x) =exA,0,ezK

zK
0=−logK˜t0,ezK
0=−logKlog(−K)et0,˜˜zK
0=−logK∂t(5.2.74)
27This condition only affects the zero modes when we are considering the quadratic relations of the qq-characters which will be derived in
section 6.2.5.

where we introduced two independent sets of zero modes
[∂t,t0] = [e∂t,˜t0] = 1,[t0,˜t0] = [∂t,e∂] = [t0,e∂t] = [˜t0, ∂t] = 0. (5.2.75)
The normal ordering is defined as
:∂tt0: =t0∂t,:˜∂t˜t0: =˜t0˜∂t. (5.2.76)
See [KN23] for the explicit derivation.
Under the above conditions, we actually have extra relations
a0(x) = :sa,0(x)
sa,0(qax):,xab,0(x) = :wabc,0(x)
wabc,0(qcx):,w¯a,0(x) =˜zqa
0(x) (5.2.77)
which imply
A(x) = :Sa(x)
Sa(qax):,Xab(x) = :Wabc(x)
Wabc(qcx):,W¯a(x) = :Z(x)
Z(qax): =eZqa(x). (5.2.78)
In our notation, the relation between the D2 and D4 operators are
Sa(x) =sa,0(x) :Xab(x)
Xab(qbx): (5.2.79)
where extra zero modes appear in front. Using these relations, we also have
A(x) =a0(x) :Xab(x)Xab(qabx)

Quantum algebraic aspects of BPS
qq-characters
In this chapter, we introduce the BPS qq-characters and BPS quiver W-algebras28of the gauge origami system and
study the quantum algebraic properties of them. In section 6.1, we give some explanations of what a qq-character is and
the motivation to study them. In section 6.2, we study basic aspects of the D4 qq-character. We study the relation with
screening charges and dicuss the BPS/CFT correspondence of the spiked instanton system. We then move on to D6
qq-characters in section 6.3. The qq-characters introduced here are novel types of qq-characters originally introduced
in the author’s paper [KN23]. We study the relation with plane partitions and discuss the BPS/CFT correspondence of
the tetrahedron instanton system. We also discuss the relation with the D4 qq-characters. Generalizations of the D6
qq-characters are discussed too. We then move on to the D8 qq-characters in section 6.4. Compared to D4 and D6
qq-characters, we do not have a screening charge so we can not derive them by the commutativity. Instead, we show
that infinite products of the D6 qq-characters produce the D8 qq-characters. We also discuss the quadratic relation of
the D6 and D8 qq-characters and its physical interpretation. In the final section 6.5, we point out observations and
discuss the relation with quantum toroidal gl1. This chapter is mainly based on [KN23] and some proofs come from
[KN24].
6.1 BPS qq-characters and BPS quiver W-algebras
The free field realization of the Witten index given in Chap. 5 implies the existence of some quantum algebraic
structure. Suppose we have the following free field realization for the k-instanton sector of a supersymmetric gauge
theory:
Tk(vi, qa):=Gk
k!I
JKkY
I=1dxI
2πixIkY
I=1A(xI)−1:Y
iV(vi) :
=Gk
k!I
JKkY
I=1dxI
2πixIZ(vi, xI) :kY
I=1A(xI)−1Y
iV(vi) :,(6.1.1)
where we took the contraction of the vertex operators at the second line and assumed that Z(vi, xI)is some rational
function. The normal product part is regular and so pole contributions only come from Z(vi, xI). Using the JK-residue
prescription, we can evaluate this contour integral and take the residues. This time, the existence of the vertex operator
part makes Tk(vi, qa)to be a summation of operators. Moreover, after taking the sum over the instanton number, we
obtain
T(vi) =∞X
k=0qkTk(vi, qa). (6.1.2)
28We do not distinguish them.
111

# ページ 112

CHAPTER 6. QUANTUM ALGEBRAIC ASPECTS OF BPS qq-CHARACTERS 112
Taking the vacuum expectation value of T(vi), one will simply get the partition function. This duality relating corre-
lation function of vertex operators and instanton partition functions is usually called the BPS/CFT correspondence
[Nek15, Nek16, Nek17a].
Given the operator T(vi), the following questions naturally arise.29
• Since they are sums of operators, they should be related with the character of some algebra. What is the algebra
whose character gives the operator T(vi)? How is that algebra related with the monomial terms of T(vi)?
• What is the algebraic structure of these operator valued Witten indices? Do they form a closed algebra?
The operators T(vi)are usually called qq-characters [Nek15] or generators of deformed W-algebras [KP15] in the
literature. The former terminology comes from the first motivation while the latter terminology comes from the
second motivation. In this thesis, we do not distinguish the terminology. See [Kim20] for an excellent review of
qq-characters and their relation with deformed W-algebras.
Instead of giving a detailed review of the qq-characters, let us study the pure SYM explained in Chap. 2 to be more
concrete. Starting from the contour integral formula for the U(1) partition function and doing the prescription given
in the previous chapter, one will find the following vertex operators
X(x) =x0(x) : exp
X
n̸=0xnx−n
:,˜A(x) =˜a0(x) : exp
X
n̸=0eanx−n

with
[˜an,˜am] =−1
nδn+m,0(1−qn
1)(1−qn
2)(1 + q−n
12),xn=˜an
(1−q−n
1)(1−q−n
2)(6.1.4)
giving
Tk(x) =1
k!(1−q12)
(1−q1)(1−q2)kI
JKkY
I=1dxI
2πixIkY
I=1˜A(xI)−1X(x) (6.1.5)
where we omitted the discussion of zero-modes. The VEV of this operator actually reproduces the contour integral
formula in Prop. 2.4.6 after redefinitions of the topological term. Strictly speaking, the zero-modes are strongly related
with the topological term and the Chern–Simons term. This is because, focusing on the zero-modes of A−1(x), the
zero-modes taking the form ed, where dis some zero-mode operator, give :ekd:or:e|λ|d:(after localization), while
the zero-modes taking the form xdgive:Qk
I=1xd
I:or: Q
∈λχ12,x()d:(after localization). Roughly speaking,
they will give operator lift ups of the topological and Chern–Simons terms.
After evaluating the JK residues, the operator will be
TSYM(x) =∞X
k=0qkZSYM[λ] :X(x)Y
∈λ˜A(χ12,x())−1: (6.1.6)
whose expectation value gives the U(1) partition function. Actually, after redefinitions of operators, this qq-character
is related with the AFS intertwiner [AFS11] (the intertwiner of quantum toroidal gl1) which is also equivalent to the
refined topological vertex [IKV07, AK08]. Somehow the deformed W-algebra interpretation of this qq-character is
still missing in the literature.
Actually, we can introduce other types of vertex operators such as
Y(x) =y0(x) : exp
X
n̸=0ynx−n
,˜Si(x) =˜si,0(x) : exp
X
n̸=0˜si,nx−n
: (i= 1,2) (6.1.7)
with
yn=˜an

Moreover, we actually have
[eT(x),TSYM(x′)] = 0 . (6.1.14)
Let us summarize what we did here. Starting from the same root current eA(x), we gave multiple vertex operators,30
and then introduced qq-characters and screening charges. Given such qq-characters and screening charges, we studied
the quadratic relations and commutativity of them. In this way, we managed to find the deformed W-algebra structure.
The generator of the q-Virasoro eT(x)is sometimes called the A1qq-character. Focusing on the non-zero modes,
we actually have the relation
:Y(x)Y(q−1
12x) :≃˜A(x) (6.1.15)
up to zero-modes. The qq-character is rewritten as
eT(x)≃Y(x) +q
Y(q−1
12x)(6.1.16)
where we are not being careful with the zero-modes again. Since the operator sum resembles the two-dimensional
representation character of SL(2)
χ(y) =y+1
y(6.1.17)
it is called the A1qq-character. Although we will not discuss in detail, taking the Nekrasov–Shatashvili (NS) limit
q2→1, the vacuum expectation value ⟨0|eT(x)eS2(x′)|0⟩becomes the q-character of the two-dimensional representa-
tion of Uq(bsl2)and each monomial term corresponds with the basis of the two-dimensional representation
Y(x)↔ :Y(x)A−1(x) :↔ (6.1.18)
We will apply this procedure to the gauge origami system and study the associated deformed W-algebra structure
and the character structure in the following sections. Before doing so, let us summarize what kind of qq-characters
arise from the free field realization of the gauge origami system given in the previous chapter:
30The vertex operators here were introduced by classifying the possible vertex operators whose contraction with the root current give a rational
function. From the physical viewpoint, the root current eA(x)comes from the gauge nodes of the low energy theory, while the vertex operators
X(x),Y(x),eS(x)correspond to the flavor nodes/framing nodes. This phenomenon is general for other cases such as the gauge origami system of
C4. In other words, gauge origami is a theory of the classification of the framing nodes.

We only list here the first term, i.e., the zero-instanton sector. This zero-instanton sector term is usually called the
highest weight in the literature.
6.2 D4 qq-characters
In this section, we study basic properties of the D4 qq-characters. These qq-characters were introduced in [Nek15]
and the corresponding algebraic structure is known to be the generator of the affine quiver W-algebra [KP15].
In section 6.2.1, we introduce the screening charges and study the commutation relations of them. We also discuss
the relation with one-dimensional partitions. In section 6.2.2, we introduce six types of D4 qq-characters correspond-
ing to the six possible configurations of D4-branes in C4in an equal footing. The commutativity with the screening
charges is discussed too. Using them we show that we can establish the BPS/CFT correspondence of the spiked in-
stanton system in section 6.2.3. We also show that the D4 qq-characters can be obtained by infinite products of the
screening currents in section 6.2.4. The quadratic relations of the D4 qq-characters are discussed in section 6.2.5.
6.2.1 Screening charges
Definition 6.2.1. Thescreening charges are defined as
Qa(x) =X
k∈ZSa(qk
ax), a∈4. (6.2.1)
Based on the observation that the D2-brane vertex operator plays role here, we also call them the D2-brane qq-
characters . Shortly, we call them D2 qq-characters.
Theorem 6.2.2. The screening charges with different indices commute with each other:
[Qa(x),Qb(x′)] = 0 , a̸=b∈4. (6.2.2)
Proof. Let us focus on the commutation relation between Q1(x)andQ4(x). Other cases are obtained by using the
quadrality. The operator products between S1(x)andS4(x)are
S4(x)S1(x′) =S23(q4x′/x) :S4(x)S1(x′) :,
S1(x′)S4(x) =S23(q1x/x′) :S1(x′)S4(x) :.(6.2.3)
We then have

where we used
A(x) = :S1(x)
S1(q1x): = :S4(x)
S4(q4x):. (6.2.5)
The commutation relation between the screening charge Q4(x)andS1(x′)is
[Q4(x),S1(x′)] =(1−q2)(1−q3)

which is a total difference. Thus, we finally have
[Q4(x),Q1(x′)] = 0 . (6.2.7)
Each term of the screening charge has a nice pictorial interpretation using the one-dimensional partition labeled
byk∈Z:
Sa(qk
ax), k∈Z⇐⇒···
qa1 2······ k(6.2.8)
The one-dimensional partition here is a one-dimensional sequence of boxes extending semi-infinitely from the left of
the border.
The screening charge Qa(x)is understood as a collection of possible one-dimensional partitions labeled by k∈Z
with the q-coordinate of the origin x:
Qa(x)⇐⇒

x ···
qa1 2······ kk∈Z

(6.2.9)
Using (5.2.78), we have
Sa(qk
ax) = :kY
i=−∞A−1(qi−1
ax) : (6.2.10)
which means we can interpret each box of the one-dimensional partition with the q-coordinates xqi−1
aas the operator
A−1(xqi−1
a). The screening charge Qa(x)is then understood as a collection of the possible one-dimensional partitions
labeled by k∈Z.
6.2.2 D4 qq-characters and affine quiver W-algebra
The main claim of this section is that the D4 Aqq-characters commute with screening charges Qa(x′)fora∈¯A.
Conversely, the commutativity uniquely determines the whole formula of the D4 qq-character.
Let us consider the qq-character generated by the D4 vertex operator XA(x) (A∈6). The D4 qq-character
generated here is identified with the generator of the affine quiver W-algebra of Γ =bA0in [KP15]. Each term of the
qq-character is decomposed into two parts, the operator part and the coefficient part. The operator part is determined
by the iWeyl reflection [NP12, NPS13] which is defined as follows.
Definition 6.2.3. The iWeyl reflection of the D4 vertex operator XA(x) (A∈6)is
XA(x)−→:XA(x)A−1(x) :, A∈6. (6.2.11)
Using the property in (5.2.80a), we have
Xab(x)−→:a0(x)−1Xab(qax)Xab(qbx)
Xab(qabx):, a̸=b∈4. (6.2.12)

# ページ 116

CHAPTER 6. QUANTUM ALGEBRAIC ASPECTS OF BPS qq-CHARACTERS 116
The operator part of the qq-character is obtained by changing the root current to the X-operators and applying the
iWeyl reflection recursively.31The operators will be classified by two-dimensional Young diagrams as
:Xab(x)Y
∈λA−1(χab,x()) : = : a0(x)−1Q
∈A(λ)Xab(χab,x())
Q
∈R(λ)Xab(qabχab,x()):. (6.2.13)
Following the correspondence in (6.2.8) and (6.2.9), we can visualize each monomial terms of the D4 qq-character
using the Young diagrams:
:Xab(x)Y
∈λA−1(χab,x()) :←→qb
qa1··· i
x1...jxqi−1
aqj−1
b
(6.2.14)
Similar to the D2-case, each A−1(χab,x())corresponds to the box of the Young diagram. The operator Xab(x)defines
the vacuum and physically gives the one-loop perturbative part (see section 6.2.3). In the algebraic context, it is called
thehighest weight of the qq-character. Moreover, as will be shown in 6.2.5, it uniquely determines the qq-character,
we also call it the generating current of the qq-character.
Theqq-character is defined by adding the monomial terms in (6.2.13) for all possible Young diagrams with specific
coefficients. The coefficients are determined by the commutativity with the screening currents.
Definition 6.2.4. We define the D4 qq-character for A∈6as
TA(x) =X
λ∈PeZD4
A[λ] : Λ A,λ(x) : (6.2.15)
where and
ΛA,λ(x) = : XA(x)Y
∈λA−1(χA,x()) :. (6.2.16)
Note that the coefficients eZD4
A[λ]do not depend on the choice of a∈¯A. One may redefine the zero-modes of the root
currents as A(x)→q−1A(x)and obtain
TA(x) =X
λ∈Pq|λ|eZD4
A[λ] : Λ A,λ(x) :, A∈6. (6.2.17)
Theorem 6.2.5. The D4 qq-characters commute with the screening charges associated with the transverse directions
[TA(x),Qa(x′)] = 0 ,∀a∈¯A. (6.2.18)
Proof. Let us focus on A= 12 anda= 4 and derive the D4 qq-character. Other cases are obtained using the
quadrality. Using the formulas in (D.4.1), we have
Λ12,λ(x)S4(x′) ="

12[λ], the qq-character commutes with the
screening charge Q4(x′):
[T12(x),Q4(x′)] = 0 . (6.2.26)
6.2.3 Spiked instantons and D4 qq-characters
Similar to the integral formula, the expanded version of the spiked instanton partition function can be expressed using
the D4 qq-characters.
Lemma 6.2.6. The operator product of {ΛA,λ(x)}A∈6is
ΛB,µ(x′)ΛA,λ(x) =ZD4-D4
1-loop (x, A|x′, B)ZD4-D4
A|B(x, λ|x′, µ) : Λ B,µ(x′)ΛA,λ(x) :. (6.2.27)
When A=B, it gives the vector and adjoint hypermultiplet contributions, while when A̸=B, it gives the
bifundamental-like contributions connecting gauge theories defined on different subspaces.

Theorem 6.2.7. The gauge origami partition function of the spiked instantons is written using the D4 qq-characters:

spk.inst. [⃗ v,⃗λ] =⟨0|Y

Depending on the value of A, B∈6, we get different instanton contributions:
•A=B: instantons in bA0quiver gauge theory
•A∩B∈4: folded instantons
•B=¯A: crossed instantons
To summarize, we have the following table of BPS/CFT correspondence.
BPS CFT

ab×S1(D4ab×1) ⟨0|Tab(v)|0⟩

gauge origami of spiked instantons ⟨0|Q
A∈6nAQ
α=1TA(vA,α)|0⟩(6.2.29)
6.2.4 Fusion of screening charges
A different way to derive the D4 qq-characters is to take infinite products of screening charges which we call the fusion
process .
Theorem 6.2.8. The D4 qq-characters are infinite products of D2 qq-characters (screening charges):
Tab(x)≃− →∞Y
i=1Qb(xqi−1
a), a̸=b∈4, (6.2.30)
where the product is− →∞Q
i=1f(xi) =f(x1)f(x2)···.
Proof. We only give a sketch of the proof (see [KP15] and [Kim20, eq. (6.2.23)–(6.2.27)] for a similar discussion).
The vertex operator Λab,λ(x)of the D4 qq-character satisfies
Λab,λ(x)∼:∞Y
i=1Sb(xqi−1
aqλi
b) : (6.2.31)
where the equality is up to zero modes. By direct computation, one can show that up to one-loop perturbative factors,32
we have33
Tab(x)≃X
λ∈P− →∞Y
i=1Sb(xqi−1
aqλi
b). (6.2.32)
Using the property that for i≤jandλi< λj
Sb(xqi−1
aqλi
b)Sb(xqj−1
aqλj
b) = 0 , (6.2.33)
32When we say one-loop perturbative factors, we are meaning the operator product coming from the highest weight vertex operators. For this
case, the operator product coming from Sb(xqi−1
a). Strictly speaking, the Sa(x)operators are not highest weights in the usual sense, but we abuse
the terminology and still call it the highest weight.
33Strictly speaking, we have to be careful of the zero-modes appearing on both hand sides. Moreover, the infinite product of the screening
currents needs to be regularized properly.

we obtain

l∈ZSb(xqaql
b) =X
k≥lSb(xqk

By computing the nontrivial coefficients appearing after taking the contractions of the screening currents, one obtains
the statement.

6.2.5 Quadratic relations of crossed instantons
Theqq-characters {TA(x)}A∈6are expected to generate a larger algebra than the affine quiver W-algebra. As usual
deformed W-algebras, studying the quadratic relations of the generators is another way to understand the algebraic
structure. Since deriving the complete quadratic relations of the {TA(x)}A∈6is beyond the scope of this paper, we
just give a part of the quadratic relations which can be derived easily.
Theorem 6.2.10. The D4 qq-characters TA(x)andT¯A(x)forA∈6(anti-)commute with each other up to trivial
zero-modes factors:
xTA(x)T¯A(x′) +qAx′T¯A(x′)TA(x) = 0 . (6.2.36)
Proof. Let us consider the commutation relations between T12(x)andT34(x′):
T12(x) =X
λFD4
12[λ] : Λ 12,λ(x) :, (6.2.37)
T34(x′) =X
µFD4
34[µ] : Λ 34,µ(x′) :. (6.2.38)
The contraction formulas give
Λ12,λ(x)Λ34,µ(x′) =h

|x′/x|≪1: Λ12,λ(x)Λ34,µ(x′) :,

we obtain the claim.
Remark 6.2.11 .The extra factors in front of the qq-characters come from the operator product of the zero modes
xA,0(x). We may modify the zero modes so that they obey (5.2.72) (see also footnote 27) and then get an exact
commuting relation [TA(x),T¯A(x′)] = 0 . Instead of doing that, we simply relax the commutativity condition and say
that operators O(x)andO′(x′)commute when they satisfy
O(x)−f(x, x′)O′(x′) = 0 (6.2.46)
where f(x, x′)are zero modes factors.
6.3 D6 qq-characters
We introduce the D6 qq-characters by using the commutativity with the screening charges in section 6.3.1. To be
concrete, we show that monomial terms of the qq-character with the highest weight W¯a(x)are classified by plane
partitions and that it commutes with the screening charge Qa(x′). We then show that the D6 qq-characters reproduce
the tetrahedron instanton partition function in section 6.3.2. The D6 qq-characters can be obtained by fusion of an
infinite number of D4 qq-characters (see section 6.3.3).
6.3.1 D6 qq-characters and plane partition
Following the construction of the D4 qq-characters and the affine quiver W-algebra, let us construct the D6 qq-
characters. The D6 qq-characters are qq-characters whose generating currents are the D6 vertex operators W¯a(x) (a∈
4)in (5.2.29). Similar to the D4 case, each term of the D6 qq-character is decomposed into the vertex operator and the
coefficient parts. The operator part is determined by the iWeyl reflection of the operator part defined as the following.
Definition 6.3.1. The iWeyl reflection of the D6 vertex operator W¯a(x) (a∈4)is
W¯a(x)−→:W¯a(x)A−1(x) :, a∈4. (6.3.1)
Using the property in (5.2.80b), the root current is rewritten in the D6 vertex operators as
W¯a(x)−→:a0(x)−1W¯a(q−1
ax)Q
i∈4\{a}W¯a(qix)
Q
i∈4\{a}W¯a(q−1
iq−1ax): (6.3.2)

121 CHAPTER 6. QUANTUM ALGEBRAIC ASPECTS OF BPS qq-CHARACTERS
The operator part is obtained by changing the root currents to the D6-operators and applying the iWeyl reflection
to the numerators recursively. After iWeyl reflections, the operators are classified by plane partitions. Let us study
some terms after applying the iWeyl reflection. The operators obtained after n-times of iWeyl reflections are called
operators at level n. We focus on the case W¯4(x)and then have
W¯4(x)−→:a0(x)−1W¯4(q123x)Q3
i=1W¯4(qix)Q
1≤i<j≤3W¯4(qiqjx):. (6.3.3)
• Level 0: We only have one operator
W¯4(x). (6.3.4)
We can associate this operator with a vacuum configuration of the plane partition in the space (1,2,3) where
there is no box:
W¯4(x)←→
1 23
(6.3.5)
The spectral parameter xcorresponds to the q-coordinates in the origin. The operator W¯4(x)represents the
addable box of this plane partition configuration which is the box in the origin.
• Level 1: After applying the iWeyl reflection once, we have
:W¯4(x)A−1(x) : = : a0(x)−1W¯4(q123x)Q3
i=1W¯4(qix)Q
i<j≤3W¯4(qiqjx):. (6.3.6)
The level 1 current can be described as
:a0(x)−1W¯4(q−1
4x)Q3
i=1W¯4(qix)Q
i<j≤3W¯4(qiqjx):←→
1 23
(6.3.7)
An observation is that the red terms W¯4(qix) (i= 1,2,3)correspond to the addable boxes of this plane partition
configuration. The variables qix(i= 1,2,3)correspond to the q-coordinates of the addable boxes. The blue
term W¯4(q−1
4x)corresponds to the removable box of the configuration, which is the box in the origin with
coordinate x.
• Level 2: Since we have three numerators in the level 1 operator, we will have three possible level 2 operators
depending on which term we do the iWeyl reflection.
1.π1,1= 1, π2,1= 1
:W¯4(x)A−1(x)A−1(q1x) :∝(2)(3)(12)(14−1)
(122)(123)←→
123
(6.3.8)
where we simply denote W¯4(qa
1qb
2qc
3qd
4x)as(1a2b3c4d). The q-coordinates of the addable boxes of this
configuration are q2
1x, q2x, q3xand correspond to the red terms in the numerator. The q-coordinate of the
removable box of this configuration is xq1and correspond to the blue term with variable q−1
4q1x.

(122)(223)←→
123
(6.3.9)
Similarly, the red terms correspond to the addable boxes and the blue terms correspond to the removable
boxes of the plane partition configuration.
3.π1,1= 2
:W¯4(x)A−1(x)A−1(q3x) :∝(1)(2)(32)(1232)
(132)(232)←→
1 23
(6.3.10)
Again, the red terms correspond to the addable boxes and the blue terms correspond to the removable
boxes of the plane partition configuration.
We can do this procedure recursively and then obtain the following statement.
Lemma 6.3.2. The operators generated from the iWeyl reflection starting from W¯a(x)are classified by plane parti-
tions:
Λ¯a,π(x):= :W¯a(x)Y
∈πA−1(χ¯a,x()) :, a∈4. (6.3.11)
Converting the root currents into the D6-operators, we have
W¯a(x)Y
∈πA−1(χa,x())∝Q
∈A(π)W¯a(χa,x())Q
∈R(π)W¯a(q−1
aχa,x())
#(6.3.12)
where we have some extra denominators determined recursively.34
The D6 qq-character is a sum of the vertex operators Λ¯a,π(x)with some specific coefficients:
T¯a(x) =X
π∈PPFD6
¯a[π]Λ¯a,π(x). (6.3.13)
We impose the condition that this qq-character commutes with the screening charge Qa(x). After imposing this
condition, the coefficient is determined uniquely.
Definition 6.3.3. We define the D6 qq-character for a∈4as
T¯a(x) =X
π∈PPeZD6
¯a[π]Λ¯a,π(x), a∈4, (6.3.14)
where the coefficients eZD6
¯a[π]are identified with the U(1) partition function of the 7d gauge theory on C3
¯a×S1in
(4.4.104). Rescaling the zero-modes A(x)→q−1A(x), we have
T¯a(x) =X
π∈PPq|π|eZD6
¯a[π]Λ¯a,π(x). (6.3.15)
34The explicit form of the right-hand side is related to the shell formula of the plane partition [FJMM11]. In this note, the information of the
denominator is not necessary so we will not write the explicit form.

Theorem 6.3.4. The D6 qq-characters T¯a(x) (a∈4)commutes with the screening charge Qa(x):
[T¯a(x),Qa(x′)] = 0 . (6.3.16)
Proof. Let us focus on T¯4(x)and see how the commutativity appears. Using the formulas in Thm. D.4.1 and the
property in (5.2.78), we have
[W¯4(x),S4(x′)] =q4xδ(q4x/x′) :W¯4(x)S4(q4x) :
[:W¯4(x)A−1(x) :,S4(x′)] =xδ(x′/x)Q3
i=1(1−qi)Q
1≤i<j≤3(1−qiqj):W123(x)S4(q4x) : +···,(6.3.17)
where for the second term, we only extracted the pole coming from x′=x. Thus, for the pole coming from W¯4(x)to
disappear up to a total difference, we need the combination
W¯4(x)−q4Q
1≤i<j≤3(1−qiqj)

i=1(1−qi):W¯4(x)A−1(x) : (6.3.18)

CHAPTER 6. QUANTUM ALGEBRAIC ASPECTS OF BPS qq-CHARACTERS 124
We have shown here that the D6 qq-character T¯a(x)is uniquely determined by the commutativity with the screen-
ing charge Qa(x)and that the coefficient factor is the U(1) partition function of the 7d theory on C3
¯a×S1. Compared
with the magnificent four system where we need to take care of the sign problem [Nek17d, NP18, NP23], our discus-
sion here gives an algebraic proof showing that there will be no sign problem for the 7d case. This is indeed compatible
with a mathematical proof given in [FM23].
Thm. 6.2.2, 6.2.5, 6.3.4 are summarized in the following theorem.
Theorem 6.3.5. LetTbe the tetrahedron corresponding to the C4geometry (see Figure 3.1). We denote the set of
vertices, edges, and faces of Tasv={a|a∈4},e={A|A∈6},f={¯a|a∈4}respectively. We also
introduce the union of them as S=v∪e∪f. For each element of i∈S, we can associate a qq-character. If i∈v, we
associate the D2 qq-character (screening charge), if i∈e, we associate the D4 qq-character, if i∈f, we associate the
D6qq-character. The qq-character associated with the elements i, j∈Tcommute with each other up to trivial zero
modes (see (6.2.46)) when iandjdo not intersect in T:
Ti(x)Tj(x′)−fij(x, x′)Tj(x′)Ti(x) = 0 ⇐⇒ i∩j=∅, (6.3.24)
where fij(x, x′)are zero modes.
Choosing the screening charge Q4(x), Thm. 6.3.5 claims that the kernel of Q4(x)is generated by Q1,2,3(x),
T12,23,13(x),T123(x). We expect that this will give a larger algebra compared with the affine quiver W-algebra given
by the kernel of two screening charges. We leave a detailed analysis of this for future work.
6.3.2 Tetrahedron instantons and D6 qq-characters
The expanded version of the tetrahedron instanton partition function can be expressed using the D6 qq-characters.
Lemma 6.3.6. The operator product of {Λ¯a,π(x)}a∈4is
Λ¯b,π(2)(x2)Λ¯a,π(1)(x1) =ZD6-D6
1-loop(x1,¯a|x2,¯b)ZD6-D6
¯a|¯b(x1, π(1)|x2, π(2)) : Λ¯a,π(1)(x1)Λ¯b,π(2)(x2) :. (6.3.25)
When a=b, it gives the vector multiplet contributions, while when a̸=b, it gives the bifundamental contribution
connecting gauge theories defined on different C3subspaces.
Theorem 6.3.7. The gauge origami partition function of the tetrahedron instanton is written using the D6 qq-
characters:
ZD6
1-loopZD6
inst.=X
⃗ πq|⃗ π|ZD6

tet.inst.[⃗ v,⃗ π] =⟨0|Y

125 CHAPTER 6. QUANTUM ALGEBRAIC ASPECTS OF BPS qq-CHARACTERS
6.3.3 Fusion of D4 qq-characters to D6 qq-characters
Let us see that the D6 qq-characters are obtained by fusion of the D4 qq-characters. By studying the zeros and pole
structure, one can show the following lemma.
Lemma 6.3.8. When the Young diagrams obey λ(2)⪯̸λ(1)with the parameters as x2=qax1(a∈¯A), we have
ZD4-D4
A|A(x1, λ(1)|qax1, λ(2)) = 0 , a∈¯A (6.3.28)
which gives
ΛA,λ(2)(x2)ΛA,λ(1)(x1) = 0 . (6.3.29)
where we used Lemma 6.2.6.
Using the above lemma, finite products of the D4 qq-characters are given as
TA(qN−1
ax)···TA(qax)TA(x) =X
λ(N)⪯···λ(2)⪯λ(1)qPN
i=1|λ(i)|eZD4
A[λ(1)]···eZD4
A[λ(N)]
×ΛA,λ(N)(qN−1
ax)···ΛA,λ(2)(qax)ΛA,λ(1)(x)(6.3.30)
for∀a∈¯A. Using the operator product and extracting the one-loop perturbative factor, we define the renormalized
N-fusion D4 qq-character as
T(N)
A;a(x) =X
λ(N)⪯···⪯ λ(1)qPN
i=1|λ(i)|NY
i=1eZD4
A[λ(i)]Y
i<jZD4-D4
A|A(qi−1
ax, λ(i)|qj−1
ax, λ(j)) :NY
i=1ΛA,λ(i)(qi−1
ax) :
(6.3.31)
Taking the limit N→ ∞ and considering infinite products of the qq-characters, we can see that they are related to the
D6qq-character.
Theorem 6.3.9. Taking the limit N→ ∞ of the renormalized N-fusion D4 qq-characters T(N)
ab;c(x)give the D6
qq-character Tabc(x):
T(N)
ab;c(x)N→∞− − − − → Tabc(x). (6.3.32)
Equivalently, we have← −∞Y
i=1Tab(xqi−1
c)≃Tabc(x) (6.3.33)
where the symbol “ ≃” means the equality is true up to one-loop perturbative factors.
Proof. Let us focus on the case T(N)
12;3(x)andT123(x). Since the infinite products diverge, we need to regularize it
properly (see for example [AKM+18]). Moreover, we need to take the inductive limit so that at large N,T(N)
12;3(x) =
T(N+1)
12;3 (x)and we denote this T(∞)
12;3(x). We only give a sketch of the proof so see [AKM+18] for details. The operator
T(∞)
12;3(x)is expanded as
T(∞)
12;3(x) =X
∅⪯···⪯ λ(2)⪯λ(1)qP∞
i=1|λ(i)|∞Y

i=1Λ12,λ(i)(qi−1
3x) : (6.3.34)
where xi=qi−1
3x. Since the right-hand side is expanded in all possible Young diagrams {λ(i)}obeying the condition
λ(i)⪰λ(i+1), the right-hand side is expanded in all possible plane partitions (see the (1,2)description in section
4.3.1): π= (λ(1), λ(2), . . . ,∅,∅, . . .). Let us show that the coefficients and the operator part indeed can be written
using the plane partition. The coefficient part will be
∞Y
i=1eZD4
12[λ(i)]Y
i<jZD4-D4

i=1W¯4(qi−1

W¯4(qi
3x): =W¯4(x). (6.3.37)
We then get the identity T(∞)
12;3(x) =T123(x).
Remark 6.3.10 .The fusion procedure can be visualized as the case of the fusion of D2 to D4. Using the correspon-
dence in (6.2.14) (see also section 4.3.1), we have
a bc
Λabc,π(x)

Λab,λ(1)(x)Λab,λ(2)(qcx)Λab,λ(3)(q2
cx)... (6.3.38)
6.3.4 General D6 qq-characters
We can consider higher rank analogs of the D6 qq-characters
T(n)
¯a(x) = : W¯a(x1)···W¯a(xn) : +···. (6.3.39)
The coefficients appearing in the expansion of the right-hand side correspond to the partition function of the U(n)
gauge theory on the D6-brane on C3
¯a×S1.
A further generalization is to add negative weights as the highest weights. General D6 qq-characters including
negative weights are written as
T(n|m)
¯a(x|y) = :W¯a(x1)···W¯4(xn)
W¯a(y1)···W¯a(ym): +···. (6.3.40)
The explicit coefficients are then obtained by imposing the commutativity with the screening charge Qa(x′).
Noticing that
W¯a(x)−1Sa(x′) =x′−1(1−q−1
ax′/x) :W¯a(x)−1Sa(x′) : (6.3.41)
gives no new poles, Wa(x)−1andSa(x′)commute with each other. The right-hand side of (6.3.40) is expanded by the
plane partitions generated by W¯a(xi) (i= 1, . . . , n )and no plane partitions generated by W¯a(yj)−1(j= 1, . . . , m ).
We expect the coefficients appearing on the right-hand side give the instanton partition function of the 7d U(n|m)
theory on C3
¯a×S1. We leave a detailed analysis of this for future work [JKN+24].
For later use, let us consider the case when there is only one positive and one negative weight:
T(1|1)
¯a(x|Kx) = :W¯a(x)
W¯a(Kx): +··· (6.3.42)

Pit reduction of D6 qq-characters When the parameter Kis generic, the coefficients are modified slightly without
changing the structure of the qq-character. However, when we tune Kto specific values, the zeros appearing will cancel
the poles, the iWeyl reflection will be restricted, and the right-hand side will not be expanded with arbitrary plane
partitions but only by specified plane partitions. This can be understood also from the extra factors in the coefficients.
When Kis tuned, the coefficient ZD6
¯a[K, π]will be zero for some plane partition configurations and such terms will
disappear from the qq-character. This procedure is well known in the literature of MacMahon representations and is
called the pit reduction [FJMM11, BFM15]. A plane partition with a pit P is a plane partition that does not contain a
box at the position P.
Let us focus on the case when a= 4. For example, when we tune the parameter KasK=q3x, we have
:W¯4(x)
W¯4(q3x): =X12(x) (6.3.48)
and the D6 qq-character will reduce to the D4 qq-character. This process is just placing a pit in q3xand reducing the

plane partition in (123) and restricting it to a Young diagram in the (12)-plane:
1 23
=⇒
1 23 (6.3.49)
Physically, this is interpreted as the Higgs mechanism and also the tachyon condensation as discussed in section 5.2.2.
When K=χ¯4,x(P)/x=qL−1

2qN−1

3) :(6.3.51)
which implies the pit reduction of the plane partition is related to higher rank generalizations of D4 qq-characters. This
fact is nothing special from the plane partition viewpoint. This is because we can pile LYoung diagrams spanning
the(23)-plane, MYoung diagrams spanning the (13)-plane, and NYoung diagrams spanning the (12)-plane on top
of each other to obtain all possible plane partitions with a pit at (L, M, N ). Note also that this decomposition in
Young diagrams is not unique and so we have multiple descriptions in the D4 qq-characters. Physically, the system
corresponding to the D6 qq-character with a pit-reduced plane partition is just the gauge origami system with folded
instantons where the Coulomb branch parameters are tuned in a specific way.
Generally, we may add another pit to the plane partition and this is called the double-constrained plane parti-
tion which was introduced in [HM18] (see also the references there) to discuss minimal models of W-algebras. Let
(L1, M1, N1)and(L2, M2, N2)be the coordinates of the two pits. The parameter Kneeds to obey the conditions of
the two pits
K=qL1−1
1qM1−1
2 qN1−1
3 =qL2−1
1qM2−1
2 qN2−1
3. (6.3.52)
Imposing this condition causes the q-parameters to be not generic anymore. The physical meaning of these types of
qq-characters and their relation with minimal models are still unclear for the moment. We note that the condition
above is just the Burge condition [BFS15, AB14], and thus the BPS/CFT correspondence arising should be an analog
of the AGT dual of minimal models of W-algebras. See also [Kim22a] where some examples of these truncations
were studied from the qq-character viewpoint.
6.4 D8 qq-characters
In this section, we derive the D8 qq-characters by infinite products of the D6 qq-characters in section 6.4.1. In
section 6.4.2, we then study the commutativity of the D6 and D8 qq-characters and show that they commute with each
other. We also discuss the physical interpretation of the commutativity. At the end the qq-character constructed here
reproduce the magnificent four partition function which establishes the BPS/CFT correspondence.

6.4.1 Fusion of D6 qq-characters to D8 qq-characters
After constructing D 2,D4,D6qq-characters, we would like to obtain D8 qq-characters that reproduce the magnificent
four partition function in (4.4.31). In the lower-dimensional cases, thanks to Thm. 6.3.5, we can define the qq-
characters by choosing the highest weight and imposing the commutativity with the screening charges. The highest
weight and the corresponding screening charges were chosen so that the associated subspaces do not intersect in the
C4geometry. However, for the D8 operators Z(x),eZK(x), the only operator that makes the operator products become
rational functions is the root current A(x). In this sense, it is natural to construct a screening charge related to the D0
operator. For the moment, we do not know how to construct such kind of screening currents. Instead, we will use
the fusion process discussed in Thm. 6.2.8, 6.3.9 to define the D8 qq-characters. Since we are interested in studying
the relation between the magnificent four system, where D8 and anti D8-branes appear, we use eZK(x)as the highest
weight.
Let us give the definition of the D8 qq-character first.
Definition 6.4.1 (D8qq-character) .The D8 qq-character is defined as
TK
4(x) =X
ρ∈SPq|ρ|(−1)σa(ρ)ZD8
4;a[ρ, K]ΛK
4,ρ(x), a∈4,(6.4.1)
where SPdenotes the set of arbitrary solid partitions extending in the four directions 1,2,3,4. The vertex operator
part is given as
ΛK
4,ρ(x) = : Z(K, x)Y
∈ρA−1(χ4,x()) :,(6.4.2)
and the coefficients are the U(1) partition functions of the magnificent four system obtained. The explicit formula
for the sign factor σa(ρ)when a= 4 is given in (4.4.39) and other formulas are obtained by using the quadrality
symmetry.
We note that actually the total coefficient (−1)σa(ρ)ZD8
4;a[ρ, K]does not depend on the choice of a∈4(see
Thm. 4.4.7) and thus the above D8 qq-character is a unique qq-character.
The main claim of this section is the following theorem.
Theorem 6.4.2. The D8 qq-character is obtained as
TK
4(x)≃← −∞Y
i=1T¯a(xqi−1
a|xqi−1
aK), (6.4.3)
where the equality is up to one–loop perturbative factors.
Let us focus on a= 4and give a proof of this theorem step by step.

Lemma 6.4.4. Given two plane partitions Π(1),Π(2)and parameters x2=q4x1, we have
ZD6-D6
¯4;K|¯4;K(x1,Π(1)|x2,Π(2)) = 0 (6.4.6)
forΠ(2)⪯̸Π(1).
Combining these lemmas, the infinite products of D6 qq-characters are expanded as

where xi=xqi−1
4and the perturbative factors are all omitted. Given a finite solid partition ρ, we can decompose it
into non-increasing finite plane partitions: ρ= (Π(1),Π(2),Π(3),···)withΠ(i)⪰Π(i+1). Since only finite numbers
ofΠ(i)will be nonempty, the topological term is q|ρ|=qP
i|Π(i)|. Moreover, by direct computation, one can easily
show that the operator part obeys
:∞Y
i=1ΛK
¯4,Π(i)(xi) := ΛK
4,ρ(x). (6.4.8)
Thus, the nontrivial part is how to obtain the coefficient part.
Proposition 6.4.5. The coefficient part obeys:

i=1eZD6
¯4[K,Π(i)]Y
i<jZD6-D6
¯4;K|¯4;K(xi,Π(i)|xj,Π(j)) = (−1)σ4(ρ)ZD8

First of all, one can show that this character is movable (see [NP18] and [Mon22] for example). The term −P4(1−
K)xjΠ(i)∨is also movable. Let χ=xiqA−1
1qB−1

3(A, B, C ∈Z≥1)be a term included in Π(i), i.e.(A, B, C )∈

but since j−i >0andA, B, C ∈Z≥1there is no unmovable part and we can safely use the reflection property
(4.4.15). The character vD6→D8above is equivalent to the following character

The index part indeed gives ZD8

Proposition 6.4.7. The sign factor s(Π)is
s(Π) = σ4(ρ) mod 2 (6.4.15)
where σ4(ρ) = #{(i, i, i, j )∈ρ|i < j}and we have
(−1)s(Π)= (−1)σ4(ρ). (6.4.16)
Proof. Let us consider the unmovable part of
j−1X
i=1P123Π(i)∨Π(j),Π(i)=X

We fix a term η=xjqA−1
1qB−1

3,(A, B, C )∈Π(j)andA, B, C ≥1. Since the plane partitions obey Π(i)⪰
Π(j)forj > i , we have (A, B, C )∈Π(i). From the plane partition condition, the character Π(i)can be decomposed
as
Π(i)= ∆ i(η) +Π(i)(η),∆i(η) =AX

because a−A, b−B, c−C≥1, j−i≥1. Since P123only contains terms where the degrees with respect to q1,2,3

6.4.2 Commutativity of D6 and D8 qq-characters
In the previous section, we derived the complete D8 qq-character including proper sign rules using the infinite products
of lower dimensional D6 qq-characters. Given such qq-characters, one would like to find the quadratic relations of
them and determine the quantum algebraic relations. In section 6.2 and 6.3, we gave a set of quadratic relations of
the D2, D4, D6 qq-characters and showed that when the qq-characters are related with D-branes spanning transverse
subspaces, they commute with each other. In this section, we give a conjecture of the quadratic relations of the D8
qq-characters and D6 qq-characters and discuss the physical implication of them.
We focus on the following D8 qq-character

4,ρ(x).(6.4.23)

133 CHAPTER 6. QUANTUM ALGEBRAIC ASPECTS OF BPS qq-CHARACTERS
Our main claim of this section is the following conjecture.
Conjecture 6.4.8. The quadratic relations of the D8 qq-characters are
fK2|K1
44 (x2/x1)TK1
4(x1)TK2
4(x2)−fK1|K2
44 (x1/x2)TK2
4(x2)TK1
4(x1) = 0 , (6.4.27)
where K1, K2are arbitrary. Moreover, this commutativity uniquely determines the sign factor (−1)σ4(ρ)up to a global
Z2symmetry.
To fix this global Z2symmetry, we can impose the sign of the first instanton contribution by hand. Imposing the
sign factor of the one-instanton to be (−1)σ4(ρ)= 1, we have
σ4(ρ) = # {(i, j)|(i, i, i, j )∈ρ, i < j }, (6.4.28)
which is the same with (4.4.39). For the moment, we do not have a proof of this conjecture, but we have checked it up
to five instantons (k≤5)by using a computer program.
At higher instanton levels k≥4, actually the factor ZD8-D8
K1|K2(x1, ρ(1)|x2, ρ(2))has poles with higher orders.
Conjecture 6.4.9. The factor ZD8-D8
K1|K2(x1, ρ(1)|x2, ρ(2))has higher order poles only at x1=x2.
Strictly speaking, to consider the quadratic relations, one needs to deal with these poles. However, to confirm the
conjecture, we excluded such poles and only focus on the contribution from poles which are single order. To include
higher order poles, we expect that we need to deal with differentiated operators. Somehow, in the context of quantum
algebra, discussions on higher order poles are not fully done. Well-known examples where this kind of phenomenon
appears are the qq-characters associated with geometries with D, E-type singularities or higher rank qq-characters
with non-trivial limits of spectral parameters. In such cases, the iWeyl reflection procedure needs to be modified and
derivatives of the vertex operators will appear (see [Nek17a, KP15] for example). In this paper, we will not make an
attempt to discuss all of these aspects and leave it for future work.
Low instanton computations To see the commutativity, focusing on the k= 0,1sectors is already intuitive. For
the zero–instanton case, the commutativity is trivial because
fK2|K1
44(x2/x1)Z(K1, x1)Z(K2, x2) =:Z(K2, x2)Z(K1, x1) :
fK1|K2
44(x1/x2)Z(K2, x2)Z(K1, x1) =:Z(K2, x2)Z(K1, x1) :.(6.4.29)
For the one–instanton case, the sign factor (−1)σ4({{{1}}})= 1,−1is arbitrary because it is an overall factor
when considering the quadratic relation. The possible configurations are (ρ(1), ρ(2)) = ({{{1}}},∅),(∅,{{{1}}}).
The contribution from (ρ(1), ρ(2)) = ({{{1}}},∅)is
fK1|K2
44(x1/x2)Z(K2, x2) :Z(K1, x1)A−1(x1) : = K21−K−1
2x1/x2
1−x1/x2:Z(K2, x2)Z(K1, x1)A−1(x1) :,
fK2|K1
44(x2/x1) :Z(K1, x1)A−1(x1) :Z(K2, x2) =1−K2x2/x1
1−x2/x1:Z(K2, x2)Z(K1, x1)A−1(x1) :(6.4.30)
which gives
fK1|K2
44(x1/x2)Z(K2, x2) :Z(K1, x1)A−1(x1) :−fK2|K1
44(x2/x1) :Z(K1, x1)A−1(x1) :Z(K2, x2)
=−(1−K2)δ(x1/x2) :Z(K1, x1)Z(K2, x1)A−1(x1) :.(6.4.31)
The contribution from (ρ(1), ρ(2)) = (∅,{{{1}}})is obtained by switching the parameters as K1↔K2, x1↔x2:
fK1|K2
44(x1/x2) :Z(K2, x2)A−1(x2) :Z(K1, x1) =1−K1x1/x2

Therefore, at the one-instanton level, the D8 qq-characters commute with each other.
Reduction to D6 qq-characters The D6 qq-characters can be obtained by reductions of the D8 qq-characters. The
relation (5.2.39) gives Z(qa, x) =W¯a(x). Under this specialization, we actually can show that the solid partition stops
its growth in one of the four directions:
ZD8
4;4[ρ;qa] = 0, ρ∈ PP a (6.4.36)
where recall that PPais the set of plane partitions not extending in the qadirection. Combining with Cor. 4.4.14, we
have the following.
Proposition 6.4.10. The D8 qq-character reduces to an expansion of plane partitions of PPa. Using
Λqa
4,π(x) = Λ ¯a,π(x), π∈ PP a, (6.4.37)
we have
Tqa
4(x) =X
π∈PP aq|π|(−1)σ4(π)ZD8
4;4[π, qa]Λ¯a,π(x) =T¯a(x).(6.4.38)
Combining with Conj. 6.4.8, we obtain the commutativity of the D6 qq-characters.
Corollary 6.4.11. The D6 qq-characters all commute with each other:
fqb|qa
44(x2/x1)T¯a(x1)T¯b(x2)−fqa|qb
44(x1/x2)T¯b(x2)T¯a(x1) = 0 , a, b ∈4. (6.4.39)
Moreover, they also commute with the D8 qq-characters:
fqa|K
44(x2/x1)TK
4(x1)T¯a(x2)−fK|qa
44(x1/x2)T¯a(x2)TK
4(x1) = 0 , a∈4. (6.4.40)
Conj. 6.4.8 and Cor. 6.4.11 show that all the D6 and D8 qq-characters commute with each other. This property
is surprising from the quantum algebraic viewpoint because usually when the generators of the deformed W-algebra
commute with each other, one would expect it to be a trivial algebra.
Relation with the plethystic exponential formulas Although, the quantum algebraic meaning of the commutativity
of the D6 and D8 qq-characters is not so clear for the moment, it has a physical meaning. The commutativity of the
D6 and D8 qq-characters is actually a consequence of the fact that the partition functions of the tetrahedron instantons
and magnificent four do notdepend on the Coulomb branch parameters (spectral parameters) and have a beautiful
plethystic exponential formula as explained in Thm. 4.4.9.

where the right hand side given in Thm. 4.4.9. Since the right hand side does not depend on {xα}n
α=1, the left hand side
should also not depend on them. Focusing on n= 2, this gives exactly the commutativity in Conj. 6.4.8. Similarly,
this discussion is applicable to the tetrahedron instanton case by tuning the parameters {Kα}n
α=1.
We stress that we are notsaying that the commutativity of the D6, D8 qq-characters proves the independence of
the Coulomb branch parameters nor the existence of a plethystic formula. We are saying that if such kind of properties
exist, then we should have the commutativity of the qq-characters and indeed for the D6, D8 qq-characters, it is true.
We also note that this commutativity is notsatisfied for D4 and D6 qq-characters. As mentioned in section 6.3.4,
we can introduce a D6- D6qq-character which after tachyon condensation, we can reproduce the spiked instanton D4
qq-characters. The commutation relation of such D6- D6qq-characters actually reproduces extra terms which imply
nontrivial quadratic relations for the affine quiver W-algebra. We postpone a detailed study of such cases for future
work.
6.5 Relation with quantum toroidal gl1
In this section, we review the quantum toroidal gl1and point out observations regarding the qq-characters we intro-
duced in the previous sections. We will show that the D 2,D4,D6qq-characters are related with the vertical represen-
tations of the quantum toroidal gl1. At the end, we have the following correspondence:

6.5.3 D4 qq-character Fock representation
6.5.4 D6 qq-character MacMahon representation
6.5.1 Quantum toroidal gl1
The quantum toroidal gl1is an infinite-dimensional quantum algebra with two independent deformation parameters
[DI96, Mik07, FJMM10, FJMM11, FFJ+10]. We follow the notations in [MNNZ23] (see also [Nos22, section 5.2,
5.3] for a review).
Definition 6.5.1. Letq1,q2,q3be the deformation parameters35with the condition q1q2q3= 1. The quantum toroidal
gl1, which is denoted E, is generated by three Drinfeld currents
E(z) =X
m∈ZEmz−m, F (z) =X
m∈ZFmz−m, K±(z) =K±exp X
r>0∓κr
rH±rz∓r!
(6.5.1)
and central elements
C, K−= (K+)−1. (6.5.2)
35In the literature, the deformation parameters of the algebra are denoted q1, q2, q3. We use a different notation to prevent confusion with the
parameters q1, q2, q3, q4introduced in this paper. As mentioned in footnote 16, the structure function g(z)is related to the structure function g¯4(z)
after taking the limit q4→1.

The defining relations are
E(z)E(w) =g(z/w)E(w)E(z), F(z)F(w) =g(z/w)−1F(w)F(z),
K±(z)K±(w) =K±(w)K±(z), K−(z)K+(w) =g(C−1z/w)

K±(C(1∓1)/2z)E(w) =g(z/w)E(w)K±(C(1∓1)/2z),
K±(C(1±1)/2z)F(w) =g(z/w)−1F(w)K±(C(1±1)/2z),

i=1(1−q−1
iz), κ r=3Y
i=1(qr/2
i−q−r/2
i), (6.5.4)
and˜g= 1/κ1.
Additionally, one needs the so-called Serre relations which are cubic relations of E(z), F(z). The representations
used in this thesis automatically satisfy them and so we omit the discussions (see [MNNZ23]). The function g(z)is
called the structure function of the quantum toroidal gl1.
The quantum toroidal gl1has a Hopf algebraic structure. We only list down the coproduct structure:
∆E(z) =E(z)⊗1 +K−(C1z)⊗E(C1z),
∆F(z) =F(C2z)⊗K+(C2z) + 1⊗F(z),
∆K+(z) =K+(z)⊗K+(C−1
1z),
∆K−(z) =K−(C−1
2z)⊗K−(z),
∆(X) =X⊗X, X =C, K−,(6.5.5)
where C1=C⊗1andC2= 1⊗C. Using this coproduct, we can construct tensor product representations.
The representations of the quantum toroidal gl1are obtained by determining the values of the central elements
C, K−. We have two classes of representations called vertical representations andhorizontal representations . Vertical
representations are representations when the central element Cis trivial: C= 1. We have three types of them.
• Vector representation [FJMM10]: (C, K−) = (1 ,1)
• Fock representation [FFJ+10]:(C, K−) = (1 ,q1/2
c) (c= 1,2,3)
• MacMahon representation [FJMM11]: (C, K−) = (1 , K1/2) (K∈C×)
Multi-dimensional partitions appear as the bases of the representation spaces of these representations. For the vector
representation, 1d partitions labeled by integers appear. For the Fock and MacMahon representations, 2d and 3d
partitions appear respectively (see [MNNZ23] and [Nos22, section 5.3.1] for the derivations).
On the other hand, horizontal representations are representations where the central charges are (C, K−) = ( q1/2
c,1) (c=
1,2,3)[Mik07, BFM15, FHS+10, Koj19, Koj21, HMNW21]. Drinfeld currents are represented in vertex operators
for these representations. See for example [MNNZ23] and [Nos22, section 5.3.2] for the explicit derivation of these
representations.
6.5.2 Vector representation and D2 qq-character
There are three types of vector representations with central charges (C, K−) = (1 ,1)and the actions of the Drinfeld
currents are

c−1)
(1−qc), S c(z) =(1−qc−1z)(1−qc+1z)
(1−z)(1−qc−1qc+1z). (6.5.7)
We denote these representations Vc(u),(c= 1,2,3). The bases {[u](c)
j}j∈Zare represented by 1d partitions:
[u](c)
j=

(6.5.8)
The operator K±(z)acts diagonally, E(z)/F(z)adds/removes boxes to/from the configuration.
To relate the D2 qq-characters with the vector representations, we choose one specific direction, which is C4, in
the gauge origami system. Let us study the relation of the qq-characters included in the C3
123×S1. The operator
products of Sc(z) (c= 1,2,3)withS4(q4z)are
Sc(qj

After taking the limit q4→1, we can see that we have
Sc4(uqj
c/z)→Sc(uqj
c/z), q 1, q2, q3→q1,q2,q3. (6.5.10)
Comparing with (6.5.6), after taking the limit q4→1, we can relate the monomial terms of the D2 qq-characters with
the bases of the vector representation of quantum toroidal gl1as36
S4(q4z)→K±(z),S1(uqj
1)→[u](1)
j. (6.5.11)
This correspondence strengthens the interpretation in (6.2.8). Due to this observation, we can call the D2 qq-characters
thevector qq-characters .
6.5.3 Fock representation and D4 qq-character
Fock representations are representations with central charges (C, K−) = (1 ,q1/2
c),(c= 1,2,3). We denote them
Fc(u),(c= 1,2,3), respectively. The actions of the Drinfeld currents are given

u() =uqi−1
c+1qj−1
c−1(i, j≥1). (6.5.13)
36Note that this is not a strict correspondence. In the limit q4→1, some of the vertex operators will diverge and they do not obey the defining
relations of the quantum toroidal gl1. Moreover, for the moment, we do not know how to relate the other operators E(z), F(z).

Note that the eigenvalue Ψ(c)

The bases are represented by 2d partitions:
|u, λ⟩(c)=qc−1
qc+1iujuqi−1
c+1qj−1
c−1
(6.5.15)
Similar to the D2 case, we choose C4to be a specific direction in the gauge origami system. Focusing on T12(x)
and using (6.2.19), we obtain
:X12(u)Y
∈λA−1(χ12,u()) :S4(q4z) ="

Y12
λ,u(z)#z
+:X12(u)Y
∈λA−1(χ12,u())S4(q4z) : (6.5.16b)
and at the limit q4→1, we have
Y12
λ,u(z)→ Y(3)
λ,u(z), χ 12,u()→χ(3)
u(). (6.5.17)
Thus, at the limit q4→1, we can relate the monomial terms of the D4 qq-characters with the bases of the Fock
representation of quantum toroidal gl1as
S4(q4z)−→K±(z),:X12(u)Y
∈λA−1(χ12,u()) :−→ | u, λ⟩(3). (6.5.18)
In this sense, we can call the D4 qq-characters the Fock qq-characters .
Remark 6.5.2 .Actually, the Fock representation can be derived by an infinite number of tensor products of the vector
representation [FJMM10]. The coproduct structure enables us to consider the action of the Drinfeld currents on tensor
product representations ⊗N
i=1Vc−1(ui). We tune the spectral parameter as ui=uqi−1
c+1and take the limit N→ ∞ .
After proper regularization of the infinite products, we obtain ⊗∞
i=1Vc−1(uqi−1
c+1)≃ F c(u). This property corresponds
with the fact that the D4 qq-character can be obtained by the fusion process of the D2 qq-characters as discussed in
Thm. 6.2.8.
Higher rank qq-characters Let us show that the higher rank D4 qq-characters correspond to the tensor product
representations of the vertical Fock representations. We only focus on the qq-characters with no negative weights. The
monomial terms appearing are
:n12Y

After taking the limit q4→1, it corresponds with the Cartan eigenvalue of the tensor product representationNn12
α=1F3(x12,α)⊗Nn13
β=1F2(x13,β)⊗Nn23
γ=1F1(x23,γ). Note that the Cartan eigenvalues of tensor product representations are simply
the products of the Cartan eigenvalue of each representation. This is because at C= 1, using the coproduct structure
(6.5.5), we have ∆K±(z) =K±(z)⊗K±(z). Note also that the ordering of the tensor products does not matter
because of the existence of the universal R-matrix37[Mik07, FJMM15, FJMM16].
6.5.4 MacMahon representation and D6 qq-character
MacMahon representations are representations with central charges (C, K−) = (1 , K1/2)where K∈C×is a generic
parameter. The action of the Drinfeld currents is given as
K±(z)|u, π⟩= [Ψ π,u(z)]z
±|u, π⟩,
E(z)|u, π⟩=X
∈A(π)#δz

where #is some coefficient factor and
χu() =uqi−1

2qk−1
3,Ψπ,u(z) =K−1/21−Ku/z
1−u/zY
∈πgz
χu()
. (6.5.22)
We denote this representation M(u, K). The explicit coefficients of the right-hand side of E(z), F(z)are omitted.
Theqq-character T123(x)and screening current S4(x′)gives
:W¯4(u)
W¯4(Ku)Y

W¯4,K
π,x(z)−1iz
+:W¯4(u)
W¯4(Ku)Y
∈πA−1(χ4,u())S4(q4z) :.
(6.5.23b)
Taking the limit q4→1, we have χ¯4,u()→χu()and
g¯4(z)−→g(z),W¯4,K
π,u(z)−1−→1−Ku/z
1−u/zY
∈πgz
χu()
(6.5.24)
which gives the identification
S4(q4z)−→K±(z),:W¯4(u)Y
∈πA−1(χ4,u()) :−→ | u, π⟩. (6.5.25)
Thus, at the limit q4→1, we can relate the monomial terms of the D6 qq-characters with the bases of the MacMahon
representation of the quantum toroidal gl1. In this sense, we call the D6 qq-characters the MacMahon qq-characters .
Under this identification, we can see that the distance between the D6 and D6branes, denoted as K, appear as the
central charge of the MacMahon representation.
Remark 6.5.3 .Instead of considering the U(1|1)theory of D6-branes, we can consider the U(1) theory by taking the
limit K→0,∞. After taking the limit q4→1, the eigenvalue Ψπ,u(z)|K→0,∞is no longer a rational function
with the same degrees in the numerator and the denominator. Note that such kind of representations are not the
representation of quantum toroidal gl1but of the shifted quantum toroidal gl1(see [Bou22, GLY21a, NW21b]).
37Recently there have been attempts to construct the qq-character using the R-matrix of the quantum toroidal gl1[Liu22, BDKZ23].

CHAPTER 6. QUANTUM ALGEBRAIC ASPECTS OF BPS qq-CHARACTERS 140
Remark 6.5.4 .Similar to the relation between the vector representations and the Fock representations, the MacMahon
representation also can be obtained by infinite tensor products of the Fock representations [FJMM11]. Consider the
tensor product ⊗N
i=1Fc(ui)and tune the spectral parameters as ui=uqi−1
c. We then take the limit N→ ∞ and
regularize it. After this process, we get ⊗∞
i=1Fc(uqi−1
c)≃ M (K, u). Note that the nontrivial parameter Kappears
from the regularization process. This property corresponds to the fusion process of the D4 qq-characters to D6 qq-
characters discussed in Thm. 6.3.9.
General D6 qq-characters Similar to the D4 case, a higher rank version of D6 qq-characters corresponds to the
tensor products of the MacMahon representations:
:NY
i=1ΛKi
¯4,π(i)(xi) :S4(q4x) =NY
i=1(−q4xi)NY
i=1h
W¯4,Ki
π(i),xi(z)−1iz
−:NY
i=1ΛKi
¯4,π(i)(xi)S4(q4x) :,
S4(q4x):NY
i=1ΛKi
¯4,π(i)(xi) : =NY
i=1(−q4xi)NY
i=1h
W¯4,Ki
π(i),xi(z)−1iz
+:NY
i=1ΛKi
¯4,π(i)(xi)S4(q4x) :.(6.5.26)
After taking the limit q4→1, one can see that it matches with the Cartan eigenvalue of the tensor productNN
i=1M(xi, Ki).
As discussed in section 6.3.4, after specifying the value K, we can obtain the pit reduction of the D6 qq-characters,
which eventually gives the D4 qq-character. This situation is the same in the quantum toroidal gl1. Setting K=qc
in (6.5.22), the Cartan eigenvalue will be (6.5.14). The residue of Ψπ,u(z)|K=qcatz=qcuwill vanish and thus the
action of E(z)will stop the growth of the plane partition in the direction qc. We then obtain the Fc(u)representation.38
For a general pit located at (L, M, N )in the MacMahon representation, the central charge is K=qL−1
1qM−1
2qN−1
3. A
similar analysis can be done and we will see that the MacMahon representation will be reduced to F⊗L
1⊗F⊗M
2⊗F⊗N

Conclusion
Gauge origami is a generalized supersymmetric gauge theory defined on several intersecting space-time components
and it provides a systematic way to consider generalizations of instantons. We focused on the gauge origami system
ofC4: spiked instanton, tetrahedron instanton, and magnificent four system. From the string theoretic viewpoint,
the instantons are understood as D1-branes probing D (2p+ 1) -branes. The low energy field theory of the D1-branes
are uniformly given by a 2d N= (0,2)quiver gauge theory. Using the quiver structure and the associated flavor
symmetries, one can compute the Witten index of it and it gives the instanton partition function. By using the same data
(quiver and flavor charges), we introduced vertex operators and gave free field realizations of the partition function.
Based on this free field realization, we managed to construct D2, D4, D6, and D8 qq-characters and show the BPS/CFT
correspondence for the spiked instanton, tetrahedron instanton, and magnificent four systems.
The D2 qq-characters play the roles of screening charges and the D 4,D6qq-characters are uniquely determined
after setting the highest weight and imposing the commutativity condition with the screening charge. An interesting
property was that the monomial terms are classified by truncations of plane partitions and we have a one-to-one
correspondence with the MacMahon representation and its generalizations (e.g. truncations, boundary conditions,
etc.) of the quantum toroidal gl1.
For the D8 qq-characters, we do not have a screening charge and so we derived it by taking infinite products of the
D6qq-characters. At the end, we managed to derive the D8 qq-character that produce the magnificent four partition
function including the nontrivial sign factors. We therefore managed to establish the BPS/CFT correspondence of all
the setups in the gauge origami system of C4.

Acknowledgement
The first and deepest gratitude goes to my supervisor, Yutaka Matsuo, for advising me for five years. Throughout
my time in graduate school, I received invaluable and insightful guidance from him in every aspect of my academic
journey. As someone who tends to take a contrarian approach, there were many times when I did not follow that
advice immediately. However, upon reflection, I now realize that much of that guidance was indeed correct. I am
deeply grateful for his patience and unwavering support over the course of these five years.
The author would also like to thank Taro Kimura. The work in this thesis is based on collaborations with him.
The author knew that Taro was working on gauge theory and deformed W-algebras before we met in person, but two
years ago I had the chance to visit France and meet him in person. At that time I was at a loss as to what to do as
a research. The lectures he gave and the discussions during the stay helped me to find out what to do next. We also
happened to be from the same hometown, so we had a lot of fun talking about our hometowns. I am deeply grateful
for the tremendous support I received from him, which enabled me to get through the three years of my Ph.D. studies.
The author is grateful to Satoshi Nawata and Rui-Dong Zhu too. The author had the opportunity to collaborate
with them on a review of quantum toroidal algebras [MNNZ23]. During the collaboration, the author managed to
broaden his understanding of quantum toroidal algebras. To be honest, the author feels that the journey to complete
the paper was not necessarily enjoyable for him, as he is a bored person. On the other hand, looking back, I am sure
that the patience I gained along the way will be invaluable to me in my future life. I would like to thank them for
their patience with me until the end and for completing the review. I sincerely hope that more readers will become
interested in the physical applications of quantum algebras after reading the review.
I would also like to express my deepest gratitude to Koichi Harada and Akimi Watanabe. They helped me a lot
with my research right after I entered graduate school. I am sure that the basis of my research activities in the doctoral
course was acquired through discussions with them.
I also thank all financial support and grants both from our government and a private company: Forefront Physics
and Mathematics Program to Drive Transformation (FoPM), a World-leading Innovative Graduate Study (WINGS)
Program, the University of Tokyo, JSPS fellowship for young students, MEXT, and JSR fellowship, the University of
Tokyo. All these add up to the foundations of my learning and inspired me to become more innovative in my search
for knowledge throughout my Ph.D. journey.
Furthermore, I am grateful to the members of the particle physics groups in Hongo, especially to Hajime Fukuda,
Kohki Kawabata, Atsuya Niki, Kantaro Ohmori, and Juntaro Wada. I have learned to see the world from more...
unconventional perspectives thanks to all the countless trivial conversations we have had.
The author is also grateful to many Japanese idols, streamers and VTubers. What they do is so interesting that I am
afraid that the total time I spent escaping reality would be a frightening amount of time. Even when I was writing this
dissertation, I was watching an online streaming for about 12 hours a day for a week or two to escape from reality.....
Finally, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my family, who supported me with warmth and care until
the very end. Without their support, I am certain I would not have been able to experience anything during these five
years in graduate school.

Spinor representations and supersymmetry
A.1 Spinor representations
We summarize the construction of spinor representations following [Pol07a, Pol07b]. We focus only on the spinor rep-
resentation of a D-dimensional spacetime where Dis even D= 2k+2and the metric is ηµν= diag( −1,+1, . . . , +1).
The Dirac matrix Γµobeys
{Γµ,Γν}= 2ηµν. (A.1.1)
Let us construct the spinor representations explicitly. We first define
Γ0±=1
2 
±Γ0+ Γ1
,Γa±=1
2 
Γ2a±iΓ2a+1
, a= 1, . . . , k (A.1.2)
which obeys
{Γa+,Γb−}=δab,{Γa+,Γb+}={Γa−,Γb−}= 0. (A.1.3)
In particular, we have (Γa+)2= (Γa−)2= 0. The operators Γa+,Γa−play roles of the creation and annihilation
operator of fermions, respectively.
To construct the representation, we first define the vacuum |Ω⟩:
Γa−|Ω⟩= 0,∀a. (A.1.4)
The bases of the representation space are then constructed by applying the creation and annihilation operators:
|⃗ s⟩=|s1, . . . , s k⟩:= (Γk+)(sk+1)/2···(Γ0+)(s0+1)/2|Ω⟩, s a=±1. (A.1.5)
We then obtain a 2k+1dimensional representation. Shortly, we omit the coefficient and only write the signs such as
|±,±, . . . ,±⟩. (A.1.6)
Note also that under this convention, the vacuum is Ω =|−,−, . . . ,−⟩.
D= 2Euclidean metric Taking |⃗ s⟩as bases, the Dirac matrices are just the Pauli matrices:
Γ2a=σ1,Γ2a+1=σ2 (A.1.7)
where the Pauli matrices are defined as
σ1=0 1
1 0
, σ 2=0−i
i0
, σ 3=1 0
0−1
(A.1.8)
obeying
{σi, σj}= 2δij,[σi, σj] = 2 i εijkσk. (A.1.9)

APPENDIX A. SPINOR REPRESENTATIONS AND SUPERSYMMETRY 146
D= 2Minkowski metric For the Dirac matrices with Minkowski metric, we have the following expression:
Γ0=iσ2,Γ1=σ1, (A.1.10)
where note that we have Γ0Γ1=σ3.
General Dwith Minkowski metric The matrix representation for general even Dcan be derived recursively. We
have a D= 2kspinor ξ(k−1)and Gamma matrices γµ(µ= 0,1, . . . , 2k−1). The k→k+ 1process gives bases
ξ(k−1)⊗ |±⟩ . The D= 2k+ 2Gamma matrices Γµcan be defined as
Γµ=γµ⊗
1 0
0−1
(A.1.11)
forµ= 0,1,2, . . . , 2k−1. Obviously, these Gamma matrices act as Γµξ(k−1)⊗ |±⟩ =±γµξ(k−1)⊗ |±⟩ .
The other two Gamma matrices Γ2k,2k+1then act on the remaining tensor component and reduces to the discussion
of the 2d Euclidean case and we have
Γ2k= 1⊗σ1,Γ2k+1= 1⊗σ2. (A.1.12)
Following this recursion relation, the Gamma matrices for 10-dimension have the following matrix representation:
Γ0= (iσ2)⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3,Γ5= 1⊗1⊗σ2⊗σ3⊗σ3
Γ1=σ1⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3, Γ6= 1⊗1⊗1⊗σ1⊗σ3
Γ2= 1⊗σ1⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3, Γ7= 1⊗1⊗1⊗σ2⊗σ3
Γ3= 1⊗σ2⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3, Γ8= 1⊗1⊗1⊗1⊗σ1
Γ4= 1⊗1⊗σ1⊗σ3⊗σ3, Γ9= 1⊗1⊗1⊗1⊗σ2.(A.1.13)
Different notation Instead of the above expression, we may reverse the order of all of the tensor components and
redefine the labels of the Gamma matrices. The result will be
Γ1=σ1⊗1⊗1⊗1⊗1, Γ2=σ2⊗1⊗1⊗1⊗1
Γ3=σ3⊗σ1⊗1⊗1⊗1, Γ4=σ3⊗σ2⊗1⊗1⊗1,
Γ5=σ3⊗σ3⊗σ1⊗1⊗1, Γ6=σ3⊗σ3⊗σ2⊗1⊗1,
Γ7=σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ1⊗1,Γ8=σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ2⊗1
Γ9=σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ1,Γ0=σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗σ3⊗(iσ2).(A.1.14)
In the main text, we will use this expression for convenience. The creation and annihilation operators are defined as
Γ0±=1
2 
±Γ0+ Γ9
,Γa±=1
2(Γ2a−1±iΓ2a), a = 1,2,3,4 (A.1.15)
and we denote the bases as
|s0, s1, s2, s3, s4⟩, s a∈ {± 1}. (A.1.16)
Define
Σµν=−i
4[Γµ,Γν] (A.1.17)
and actually it obeys the Lorentz algebra:
[Mµν, Mρσ] =−i(ηµρMνσ+ηνσMµρ−ηνρMµσ−ηµσMνρ). (A.1.18)
The generators Σ09,Σ2a−1,2a(a= 1, . . . , 4)commute with each other and are simultaneously diagonalizable. We
then define
S0= 2iΣ09, S a= 2Σ2a−1,2a,(a= 1, . . . , 4) (A.1.19)

and we have
Sa|⃗ s⟩=sa|⃗ s⟩, s a∈ {± 1}. (A.1.20)
The bases {|⃗ s⟩}give the 2k-dimensional spinor representation of the Lorentz algebra but actually it is not irreducible
because we have
Γ = Γ0Γ1···Γ9(A.1.21)
obeys Γ2= 1,{Γ,Γµ}, and[Γ,Σµν]which means the representation space can be further decomposed into eigenspaces
with eigenvalues ±1.
We further have
Γ =S0S1···S4, S 0= Γ0Γ1, S a=−iΓ2a−1Γ2a(a= 1,2,3,4), S2
i= 1 ( i= 0,1,2,3,4). (A.1.22)
We also have aY
i=1Γ2i−1Γ2i!2
= (−1)a. (A.1.23)
Lorentz transformation of the spinors The Lorentz transformation acts on the spinor as
ξ→expi
2ωµνΣµν
ξ. (A.1.24)
For example, the rotation in the Euclidean subspace gives
exp 
iωΣ2a−1,2a
= expω
2Γ2a−1Γ2a
= exp
iω
2σ3
(A.1.25)
where ωis identified with the rotation angle of the Euclidean plane.
A.2 Preserved supersymmetries
We summarize the preserved supersymmetries of branes in M-theory and string theory. See [GK98] for example.
InD= 11 , the irreducible spinor representation is the 32spinor representation. The 32 supercharges belongs to
this spinor representation. Denoting the Gamma matrices as
Γµ, µ= 0,1, . . . , 9,Γ♮(A.2.1)
where Γ♮is the Gamma matrix of the M-theoretic 11-dimension, they obey
Γ0Γ1···Γ♮= 1. (A.2.2)
If we write the 32 supercharges as Qα, the supercharge generally takes the form as Q∼ξαQαandξαwill be the 32
dimensional spinor.
Let us consider the supercharges preserved when we have M2 and M5-branes. By the rotational symmetry, the
supercharges preserved take the form
M2(012) : Γ0Γ1Γ2ξ=±ξ
M5(01234) : Γ0Γ1Γ2Γ3Γ4ξ=±ξ(A.2.3)
where the ±sign corresponds to the M-brane and anti M-brane, namely the orientation of the membranes. Note that
(Γ012)2= 1and thus such kind of spinors will always exist. The condition above projects the 32spinor representation
to one of the 16 dimensional spinor representation as 32=16⊕16′transforming under SO(1 ,2),SO(1 ,4)acting
on the M-branes. Namely, only 16 supercharges are preserved.

APPENDIX A. SPINOR REPRESENTATIONS AND SUPERSYMMETRY 148
Type IIA string theory InD= 10 , the Dirac matrix Γ≡Γ♮determines the chirality and the spinor representa-
tion is constructed by {Γµ}9
µ=0. The 32 supercharges of the string theory will act as the 16spinor representation.
Decomposing the 32 supercharges into 16 supercharges as Qα,˜Qβ, each of them needs to transform under the 16
representation of SO(1 ,9). The supercharges schematically takes the form as
Q=ξL,αQα+ξR,βeQβ, (A.2.4)
Note here that the ξL(R),αare elements of the 16-dimensional irreducible Weyl representation.
In type IIA string theory, the two sets of 16 supercharges have opposite chiralities:
ΓξL=ξL,ΓξR=−ξR. (A.2.5)
The supersymmetries preserved by the branes are summarized as
F1(01) : Γ0Γ1ξL=ξL,Γ0Γ1ξR=−ξR
NS5(012345) : Γ012345ξL=ξL,Γ012345ξR=ξR
Dp(01···p) : Γ01···pξR=ξL,(A.2.6)
where we shortly wrote Γ01···p= Γ0Γ1···Γp.
Type IIB string theory To obtain the type IIB string theory, we can take one of the space direction and take T-duality.
The two sets of 16 supercharges have the same chiralities:
ΓξL=ξL,ΓξR=ξR. (A.2.7)
The preserved supersymmetries for each brane are given by
F1(01) : Γ01ξL=ξL,Γ01ξR=−ξR
NS5(012345) : Γ012345ξL=ξL,Γ012345ξR=−ξR
Dp(01···p) : Γ01···pξR=ξL.(A.2.8)

Appendix B
Open string spectrum
In this chapter, we briefly review how to analyze the massless degrees of freedom coming from the open string
spectrum in superstring theory. See [GSW88, Pol07b] for standard references.
B.1 Bosonic Excitation
Let us focus on the bosonic part of the action of the worldsheet theory:
S=1
8πZ
dτZπ
0dσ 
(∂τX)2−(∂σX)2
(B.1.1)
where τ, σare the coordinates of the worldsheet. τis the time direction and σis the space direction, and the ends of
the string are at σ= 0, π. We set the slope parameter α′= 2for simplicity. When considering superstring theory, we
have 10 bosonic variables denoted as Xµbut we focus on one bosonic component for the moment.
We introduce the light-cone coordinates as σ±=τ±σand∂±= (∂τ±∂σ)/2. From the variations of the action,
we have the equation of motion
∂+∂−X= 0 (B.1.2)
and the boundary condition
[∂σXδX ]σ=π
σ=0= 0. (B.1.3)
We can impose two possible boundary conditions for each of the ends σ= 0, πand they are called the Neumann (N)
and Dirichlet (D) boundary conditions:
N: ∂σX|σ=0,π= 0,
D: δX|σ=0,π= 0⇔∂τX|σ=0,π= 0⇔X=const.(B.1.4)
For the Neumann boundary condition, we have
∂+X|σ=0,π=∂−X|σ=0,π (B.1.5)
because of ∂σX|σ=0,π= 0. For the Dirichlet boundary condition, we have
∂+X|σ=0,π=−∂−X|σ=0,π (B.1.6)
because of ∂τX|σ=0,π= 0.
The energy-momentum tensor is defined as
T++=1
2∂+X∂+X, T −−=1
2∂−X∂−X. (B.1.7)
For the open string case, the boundary conditions relate the left-moving and right-moving modes of the boson and the
energy-momentum tensor obeys the condition:
T++=T−−. (B.1.8)
149

# ページ 150

APPENDIX B. OPEN STRING SPECTRUM 150
Note that these energy-momentum tensors are defined only at the domain σ= [0, π]. Combining them and extending
the domain to σ= [0,2π]is useful; this method is known as the doubling trick :
T++(τ, σ):=(
T++(τ, σ), (0≤σ≤π)
T−−(τ,2π−σ),(π≤σ≤2π). (B.1.9)
Under this definition, we have T++(τ,2π) =T++(τ,0)and the mode expansions are given as
T++(τ, σ) =X
n∈ZLne−inσ+.(B.1.10)
Depending on which boundary condition we impose on the two ends, we have four possible cases.
•NN boundary condition : We impose N boundary conditions to both ends σ= 0, π. Under this boundary
condition, the mode expansions obeying the EOM is
X(τ, σ) =x+ 4pτ+ 2iX

After quantization, we have
[X(σ),˙X(σ′)] = 4 πiδ(σ−σ′),[x, p] =i,[αn, αm] =nδn+m,0. (B.1.12)
The current ∂+Xis expanded as
∂+X= 2p+X

where we defined α0= 2p. The doubling trick can be performed as
∂+X(τ, σ) =(

•DD boundary condition : D boundary conditions are imposed on both ends:
X(τ,0) = v0, X (τ, π) =vπ. (B.1.16)
The mode expansion is given as
X(τ, σ) =v0+vπ−v0

After quantization, we have

For convenience, we can introduce α0= (vπ−v0)/2πwhich gives

Zero-point energy Given the above mode expansions, an observation is that the current ∂+X(τ, σ)obeys the pe-
riodic boundary condition ∂+X(τ, σ) =∂+X(τ, σ+ 2π)for the NN, DD boundary conditions, while it obeys the
anti-periodic boundary condition ∂+X(τ, σ) =−∂+X(τ, σ+ 2π)for the ND, DN boundary conditions.
Let us compute the zero-point energy for the above cases. For periodic boundary conditions, we have

The EOM is given by
∂−ψ+= 0. (B.2.2)
Depending on the boundary conditions, we have two sectors called the NS sector and the R sector :
NS: ψ+(τ, σ) =−ψ+(τ, σ+ 2π)
R: ψ+(τ, σ) = + ψ+(τ, σ+ 2π).(B.2.3)

G−−(τ,2π−σ) ( π≤σ≤2π). (B.2.10)
After this doubling trick, the condition of the NS/R sector is simply given as G++(τ,2π) =−G++(τ,0)for the NS
sector and G++(τ,2π) = + G++(τ,0)for the R sector.
The explicit boundary conditions for the fermions are obtained by using (B.1.4), (B.1.5) and (B.2.9). Let us
summarize the boundary conditions for the fermions for the NN, DD, DN, ND boundary conditions.
• NN boundary condition: We have
NS sector :ψ+=−ψ−
R sector :ψ+=ψ−(B.2.11)
forσ= 0and
ψ+=ψ− (B.2.12)
forσ=π. The doubling trick is performed as
ψ+(τ, σ) =(
ψ+(τ, σ) (0 ≤σ≤π)
ψ−(τ,2π−σ) ( π≤σ≤2π)(B.2.13)
and the boundary conditions are summarized as
NS sector :ψ+(τ,2π) =−ψ+(τ,0)
R sector :ψ+(τ,2π) = + ψ+(τ,0).(B.2.14)
• DD boundary condition: We have
NS sector :ψ+= +ψ−
R sector :ψ+=−ψ−(B.2.15)
forσ= 0and

and the boundary conditions are summarized as

For each cases, the mode expansions can be obtained by using (B.2.4).
Zero-point energy Due to the Grassmann property of the fermion, the zero-point energy for the periodic and anti-
periodic boundary conditions are computed as follows:

B.3 Light Cone Gauge
Up to the previous section, we were focusing only when we have one boson and one fermion. In superstring theory,
we have 10 copies of them and the worldsheet action for the open string is given as
L=1

∂+Xµ∂−Xµ+iψµ
+∂−ψ+µ+iψµ
−∂+ψ−µ(B.3.1)
where µ= 0,1. . . ,9andσ= [0, π]. After the doubling trick, we can extend the domain to σ∈[0,2π]and the
energy-momentum tensor and supercurrents are defined as
T++=1
2∂+Xµ∂+Xµ+i
2ψµ
+∂+ψµ, G ++=ψµ
+∂+Xµ. (B.3.2)

To study the spectrum, we take the light-cone gauge. To make the discussion explicit, let us consider a setup with one
Dp-brane spanning in the 0123···pdirection. In this setup, the boundary conditions are
NN:X0, . . . , Xp
DD:Xp+1, . . . , X9.(B.3.3)
Under these boundary conditions and the doubling trick, the bosons are all periodic. The fermions are all anti-periodic
at the NS sector while they are all periodic at the R sector. We define
X±=1√
2(X0±X1), ψ±

We assume p≥1to take the light cone gauge
X+= 4p+τ, ψ+

and we can solve T++=G++= 0. Let us focus on T++= 0:

The zero-point energy is given as

We finally have the mass of the (p+ 1) -dimensional particles
m2:= 2p+p−−pX
j=2pjpj=bN−E0
2. (B.3.9)
Let us study the spectrum explicitly. For the NS spectrum, the Fock vacuum |k⟩where khere is the momentum
eigenvalue gives
m2=−E0
2=−1
4(B.3.10)
which is tachyonic. This state is removed by GSO projection by imposing (−1)FNS|k⟩=−|k⟩and using the projec-
tion(1 + (−1)FNS)/2. The first excited states given by N= 1/2are massless
m2= 0. (B.3.11)
The GSO projection preserves these states and we have ψi
−1/2|k⟩(i= 2, . . . , 9). They will decompose into the
vector representation of SO(p−1)(states coming from the longitudinal directions ψl
−1/2withl= 2, . . . , p ) and
the scalar representation of SO(p−1)(states coming from the transverse directions ψl
−1/2withl=p+ 1, . . .9).
The particles ψl
−1/2(l= 2, . . . , p )give the vector fields of the U(1) gauge theory on the D-brane while the particles
ψl
−1/2(l=p+ 1, . . . , 9)are scalar fields.
Let us move on to the R spectrum. In this case, the level N= 0states give
m2= 0. (B.3.12)
The zero-modes ψi
0(i= 2, . . . , p )form the spinor representation of SO(p−1). After GSO projection half of them
remains and we have 8 states.
The massless states given above actually comes from the dimensional reduction of the 10 dimensional super Yang–
Mills theory with gauge group U(1) . We can generalize the story to parallel D-branes and the result will be a U(N)
gauge theory where Nis the number of D-branes.

Special functions
C.1 q-functions
Theq-Pochhammer symbol is defined as
(x;q)n=n−1Y
m=0(1−xqm). (C.1.1)
We can formally take the limit n→ ∞ for|q|<1as
(x;q)∞=∞Y
m=0(1−xqm), (C.1.2)
which is equivalent to
(x;q)∞= exp
−∞X
m=1xm
m(1−qm)!
. (C.1.3)
For the region |q|>1, using the analytic continuation, we have
(x;q)∞= (xq−1;q−1)−1
∞. (C.1.4)
Note that we also have the following relation:
(x;q)n=(x;q)∞
(xqn;q)∞= exp
−∞X
m=1xm
m1−qmn
1−qm!
. (C.1.5)
We can also define the multiple variable version of the q-shifted factorial for the analytic region |q1,...,k|<1as
(x;q1, . . . , q k)∞=Y
0≤n1,...,n k≤∞(1−xqn1

C.2 Delta function and commutation relations
Definition C.2.1. The delta function δ(x)is a Laurent polynomial defined as
δ(x) =X
m∈Zxm.(C.2.1)
We have the following properties.
157

# ページ 158

APPENDIX C. SPECIAL FUNCTIONS 158
Proposition C.2.2. Letf(z)be a rational function and then we have
f(z)δ(z/a) =f(a)δ(z/a). (C.2.2)
Proposition C.2.3. The delta function obeys
δ(x) =1
1−x+x−1
1−x−1. (C.2.3)
Generally, we have
Q
i(1−αiz)Q
j(1−βjz)−z|{i}|−|{ j}|Q
i(z−1−αi)Q
j(z−1−βj)=X
kQ
i(1−αi/βk)Q
j̸=k(1−βj/βk)δ(βkz). (C.2.4)
The first term of (C.2.3) is understood as a rational function in the analytic region |x|<1, while the second term
is understood as a rational function in the analytic region |x|>1. The above relation is obtained by the following
expansion
1
1−x=∞X
n=0xn,|x|<1,
x−1
1−x−1=∞X
n=1x−n,|x|>1.(C.2.5)
Namely, the delta function captures the singularity coming from the pole.
Focusing on the case of (C.2.4) when we only have one numerator and one denominator, the above relation can be
obtained as
1−az
1−bz= (1−az)∞X
n=0(bz)n,a
b1−a−1z−1
1−b−1z−1=a
b(1−a−1z−1)∞X
n=0(bz)−n,
1−az
1−bz−a
b1−a−1z−1
1−b−1z−1=
1−a
b
δ(bz).(C.2.6)
We also use the following notations.
Definition C.2.4. Letf(x)be a rational function of a variable x. We denote the Laurent expansion in x∓1as
[f(x)]x
±=±∞X
m=m±f±
mx∓m, (C.2.7)
for some m±∈Z.
Example C.2.5. For example, we will be using the above notation as

1−bxx
+= (1−ax)∞X
n=0(bx)n,1−ax
1−bxx

Technical proofs
E.1 Proof of sign rules of the magnificent four system
In this section, we give the proof of Thm. 4.4.8 following the original paper [NP18].
Theorem E.1.1. The JK-residue of the integrand obeys the identity:
Gk×Res
x=xρx−1ZD8-D0
k (v, Kv, x I) = (−1)σa(ρ)ZD8
4;a[ρ, K]. (E.1.1)
Proof. We show this by induction. For the |ρ|= 1case, this is shown in (4.4.68). We assume that the claim is true for
|ρ|=kand let us consider the case for ˜ρ=ρ+χ, where χis an additional box to the solid partition ρ. We denote
{x∗
I}k
I=1theq-coordinates of the boxes in the solid partition which is given in the monomial ordering (4.3.18). The

Using Prop. 2.4.5, the extra sign factor comes from the term P∨

k+1. If this term is unmovable, then it
means that it contains the pole xk+1=χand thus after taking the residue we obtain an extra sign factor. Let us
determine the condition so that χgives an extra sign factor.
We introduce
Kρ=kX
I=1x∗
I=µ4X
i=1vqi−1
4πi(q1, q2, q3) (E.1.3)
where πiis the character of plane partitions {πi}obeying the non-increasing condition and µ4∈Z≥1is the height of
the solid partition in the 4th direction. Since the JK residue is taken in a monomial ordering, we have two possibilities
on how χis added to the solid partition:
1.χ=qµ4
4v: A new box is added to the solid partition and it increases the height of the solid partition.

2.χ=vqµ4−1
4η: The box η=qµ1−1
1qµ2−1
2qµ3−1
3 (µ1µ2µ3≥2)is a new box added to the plane partition πh.
Note that from the assumption of the monomial ordering (4.3.18), it is enough to consider only at this level.
The first situation is computed as
P∨
123χ−1Kρ=P∨
123µ4X
i=1qi−1−µ4
4 πi
=−P123µ4X
i=1(q123)µ4−iπi.(E.1.4)
Since πitakes the form as q≥0
1q≥0
2q≥0
3, when 1≤i≤µ4−1, this term is movable. When i=µ4, since there is a box
atχ= (1,1,1, µ4+ 1), we also have a box at (1,1,1, µ4)due to the solid partition condition and thus πµ4= 1 + ···.
The unmovable term is given [−P123πµ4](0)=−1and thus we have an extra sign factor.
For the second situation, it is computed as
P∨
123χ−1Kρ=P∨
123µ4X
i=1qi−µ4
4η−1πi. (E.1.5)
Note that from the solid partition condition η∈πifori≤µ4−1andη /∈πµ4. We decompose πias the following
πi=(
∆i(η) +πi(η)i= 1, . . . , µ 4−1,
∆µ4(η) +πµ4(η)−η, i =µ4(E.1.6)
where
∆i(η) =µ1X
a=1µ2X
b=1µ3X
c=1qa−1
1qb−1
2qc−1
3 (E.1.7)
andπ(η)contains terms with πi∋(a, b, c ),(a > µ 1)∨(b > µ 2)∨(c > µ 3). First of all, the term coming from
πi(η)is movable. We first have
P∨
123µ4X
i=1(q123)µ4−iπ(η)q−µ1+1
1 q−µ2+1
2 q−µ3+1
1 =−P123µ4X
i=1X
(a,b,c)∈πi(η)(q123)µ4−i−1qa−µ1
1qb−µ2
2qc−µ3
3.(E.1.8)
Fori≤µ4−1, the terms have powers with strictly positive power in either q1,2,3. For i=µ4:

−P123X
(a,b,c)∈πi(η)(q123)−1qa−µ1
1qb−µ2
2qc−µ3
3
(0)
= 0. (E.1.9)
This can be derived as follows. Since the plane partition condition obeys (a, b, c )<(µ1, µ2, µ3), without loss of
generality we can assume c≤µ3. Assuming a > µ 1, we have c=µ3, b < µ 2orc < µ 3. For the case c < µ 3, we
haveqc−µ3−1≤−2
3 and thus we have no unmovable terms. Similarly, for the case c=µ3, b < µ 2, it will be movable
because of the term qb−µ2−1≤−2
2 .
The remaining term is computed as

Combining both cases, the extra sign factor gives
σ4(˜ρ) =σ4(ρ) +µ4−1X
i=1δµ1=µ2=µ3=i (E.1.11)
which concludes the proof.
E.2 Proof of identity (4.4.86)
Lemma E.2.1. We have the identity
nX
α=11−K−1
α
(1−qα)(1−K−1αq−1α)=1−Qn
α=1K−1
α
(1−q)(1−Qn
α=1K−1αq−1), (E.2.1)
where qα=qQn
β=α+1Kβ.
Proof. We show it by induction. When n= 1, it is trivial. Assume that for all ≤n, the above identity is true. For
n+ 1, we have
n+1X
α=11−K−1
α
(1−˜qα)(1−K−1α˜q−1α)=nX
α=11−K−1
α
(1−˜qα)(1−K−1α˜q−1α)+1−K−1
n+1
(1−˜qn+1)(1−K−1
n+1˜q−1
n+1)(E.2.2)
where ˜qα=qQn+1
β=α+1Kβ=qαKn+1forα < n + 1and˜qn+1=q. Then, by the inductive hypothesis, we get
1−Qn
α=1K−1
α
(1−qKn+1)(1−Qn+1
α=1K−1αq−1)+1−K−1
